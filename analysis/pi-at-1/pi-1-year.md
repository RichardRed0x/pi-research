There is yet to be a proposal with less than 20% voter turnout, probably related to the minimum quorum requirement of 20%. Above the average the distribution is more stretched, with a number of proposals having >40% turnout and the first Ditto proposal breaking 50%. 

![](Politeia-proposals-approval.png)

Most of the approved proposals are overwhelmingly approved. The approval threshold is 60%, but 18 of 25 approved proposals had > 80%, 13 had >90% approval.

This is based on my own quick categorization of the proposals. Aside from a lot of marketing proposals no other type dominates the platform.

The functionality to output stats about Treasury spending has not yet been developed for Politeia, so it is not possible to know how much has been paid out for each of the approved proposals so far. The following graph shows the total (maximum) budget approved in each of the domains, but where these budgets have been approved recently it is likely they have not all been spent yet. There are also areas of the project which are not yet well covered by Politeia proposals, like software development, where many of the teams who were working pre-Politeia are still working.

Interesting to note that there are quite a few proposals from people who were already a contractor when they submitted the proposal, around 35% of proposals are from contractors. Proposals from contractors are also more likely to be approved. This is I think quite illustrative of one side of Politeia, where it serves as a way for the stakeholders to give their continued backing to the contractors who are active in important areas and whatever decisions they made which warranted a proposal.

This scatterplot shows all the proposals, positioned according to their turnout and approval, sizes by max cost and colored by domain.
