The work amount related to key platforms – such as stakepool main repo, dcrweb, voting dashboard, decrediton, dcrdata and potentially some of the communication items (digital and print) is not that significant. Shooting from the hip, I would imagine some 30-35 hours the most for the coordination, implementation and related tasks for 3-4 people. Most certainly this will be somewhat on-going work for a period of time, as it will be difficult to get all the stakepool owners to update in a coordinated manner (simply too many people) as well I imagine some odd instances may turn up with time.

The dev team also regularly puts proposals up for voting, and you can join one of the chat endpoints (#politeia in slack) if you want to specifically ask one to be put up for voting.

This has been addressed in my [recent blog entry](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/).  As monthly invoices are rolled up into a monthly payout, there is an auditing process.  If contractors are found to be billing large amounts without corresponding public deliverables, they are asked about their work, and can potentially have their invoice payment delayed.  This will become more automated over the next few months with the contractor management system.  Asking stakeholders to judge the quality of particular research strikes me as a bad idea because they don't necessarily possess the domain knowledge to judge the quality of that research, the same way most stakeholders are not in a position to judge code quality.3. Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc.  Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved.4.

Why I support this:- Provide data that the community can leverage for collective intelligence and ultimately informed decision makingSome areas of research areas relevant to Decred can be:1How to increase antifragility and protect agaisnt consensus failures or majority attacks.2 Gini coefficient, and state of decentralization.3Privacy Research, to what extent should privacy be implemented, does it contradict or clash nation state laws.4DAE applicable research like, contractor rates of pay, how to pay fairly and audit in a manner that does not remove autonomy.5Policies to enforce in the event of misbehaving miners.These are just some examples of areas and not formulated research questions.

Specifically, from someone who is not close to the decred developers/contractors and their processes. I didn't know that most contractors start with a 12 hour week billing cap, for example. Thank you for that information, that's helpful and an example of what I wanted to learn from my inquiry. From looking at another comment, I also glean the following information - ""Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc. Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved."" If there is some kind of standard decred contractor process that will be followed, I'm not aware of any public documentation that outlines those details. If a standard decred contractor process is to be followed, that should be noted and documentation should be linked in proposal.My questions still stand, that I would like to see a more detailed breakout of how the funds are budgeted (even if just napkin math with assumptions) before approving the proposal when it goes to voting. I don't have a lot of confidence in ""$10,000 should last a few months"" just at face value.An example of what I'm looking for would be (given the new information provided since the original proposal):**Budget**_Assuming 4 new contractors would be brought on for this project with the introductory billing cap and billrate, the project has funding for ten weeks._**_4 new contractors x 12 hours/week billing cap x 20 USD/hour x 10 weeks = $9,600]_**This also provides transparency and accountability in the case billing were to vastly differ from a proposal budget.

Sophisticated intelligence can help us make much better decisions. Someone knowledgeable could share the numbers, but I bet nation states spend a ton of money on intelligence.After reading the prop for the first times I felt it is too abstract and that I don't fully understand what work will be done, so I see why people might be confused. Adding more examples of work would benefit this proposal. So I started writing down ideas for a few days.## Existing workFirst I realized that some in the spirit of this proposal _already happens_:* [Politeia Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qnye8/politeia_digest_issue_1_a_short_weekly_update_on/)* [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/)* [@zubairzia's articles](https://medium.com/@zubairzia)* [@permabullnino's articles](https://medium.com/@permabullnino)* the [list of exchanges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/) supporting Decred, maintained by snr01 (has many exchanges not listed by coinmarketcap!)* the new [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) repository* please share any others you knowAs zubairzia0 noted, this could be so much more. Wait for it...## Decred Intelligence Group (DIG)First I called it Decred Intelligence Agency (DIA), but DIG sounds more fun, right?Below are some research ideas:* Expand the [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) into more thorough ongoing monitoring project that would track articles on all languages, and possibly track videos and podcasts mentionin Decred. Then add additional datasets with subjective metrics like quality.* Ask @permabullnino (Twitter [@ImacallyouJawdy](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy)) if he has any studies planned.* Collect and organize info about services that support Decred. Services like exchanges, wallets, payment processors and such. Dig their backgrounds, try to see which are trustworthy and reliable. This also includes actually testing them. People do it already in #marketing before announcing integrations, but I see opportunities for this process to become more organized, involve more people and produce more knowledge. snr01 has a nice spreadsheet already, and I have some drafts on this.* Track how ratings agencies rank Decred and maybe try to educate them.* Write tools to automatically detect new first time contributors (I need this for the Journal)* The definitive index of community discussions. Something similar to Community Discussions section in the Journal, but as a separate project with more frequent updates and wider coverage.* An archive of event reports.Then there are opportunities for more deep research that might have strategic value:* Study the pain points of running Decred full nodes to get more people to run them.* Track which projects build on Decred or btcsuite codebase. This can be useful for marketing, recruiting and harvesting upgrades for the codebase.* Find and connect with communities that might be interested in Decred's mission, e.g. local open source hacker communities. This effort can collaborate with marketing people and benefit marketing and recruiting.* Watch projects active in the governance space and learn from their experience. Maintain a list/analysis of projects, tech and ideas relevant to the governance sub-domain. Compare them to Decred, see if Decred could incorporate anything good.* Analyze narrative in social media for a given subject. Example: this year there was a lot of criticism of on-chain governance and coin voting from prominent Ethereum contributors. As we figured, their criticism applies quite well to Ethereum but not so well to ""money only"" project like Decred.* Monitor and analyze criticism, trolling and info attacks on social media. There were several cases when a few previously unknown Reddit accounts showed up and furiously attacked some aspects of Decred, representing themselves as parts of larger offended group (e.g. poorly handled contractors) and painting things in too dramatic ways. This is potentially damanging to Decred project and ideally should be detected and revealed to the community as quickly as possible. This could involve timing and linguistic analysis of messages. I did a few of such analyses for r/decred manually and I can say it consumes a lot of time.* Analyze general social media sentiment towards Decred. This could involve going as far as automation with sophisticated crawlers and machine learning. Could be a collaboration with teams that already work in this domain, e.g. [BittsAnalytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7vqaty/nice_sentiment_uptick_on_decred_based_on_our/).Finally, there are some interesting topics I would like to see researched but they require expertise in fields like programming or legal knowledge, while some can be only done by the developers. Still, let's not them for completeness:* Some areas of research that zubairzia0 noted.* Collect interesting stats from the blockchain (see a few examples in the Network stats [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/2), but this will move soon).* Stats from social media.* What legal and tax status does Decred staking have in different countries?* Watch the space of open hardware, look out for any devices to more securely run Decred. Perhaps even fund some (many have very nobel goals but suffer to get funded).* Watch the topic of ASIC resistance and analyze interesting events.* Watch the development of Lightning Network and produce short updates specifically targeted at Decred stakeholders.* Why we should feel safe using Go, which is influenced by Google.Regarding concerns about money waste: continued payouts are a good incentive to impress stakeholders with good intel so that they keep funding this project.","fd69a58cd1b1944147662a48a13727325e9558258bdb7c7b7eeb1cd65b6376f383455b4507462971ed9f8a14b0a013e6f0ff94a8b161eabd934b958550b96c08","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","32","e47e2728e481f4f98230b95e6322eac5a5e9ddbccfe50beffa1a85b0236397d559d531467414825989af9bfe6c0550e14c2eb76efe910c7db744d5dcf882510e",1540681713,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Research",5,5

I agree that work in the spirit of this proposal already happens (and count some of my own among it, like my analyses of the [Dash treasury](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/dash-analysis/tree/master)). It is not my intention that _all_ research work for Decred should have to go through this proposal. Anyone is free to take on some work they see value in and submit it for review in the usual way.One of my aims with this proposal is about developing methods for the community to signal which research projects they see value in - so that people who do not have confidence in their read of what the community values can sidestep that issue and work on research projects that the community has signaled support for. Or, add their own ideas into the mix and see if the community sees value in them.I like some of your ideas, and I like some of @zubairzia's ideas, but there are others I am lukewarm about. I don't see it as my place to decide whether each of those ideas are worthwhile or not. I think it would be sub-optimal to maintain a huge list of every research idea that a community member shares and say that we'll pay for work on any of those. Some have more value than others, and we should be encouraging people to work on the more useful projects, once we figure out what they are.The other main aim of this proposal as I see it is to develop a more collaborative environment for conducting research, along with embedding standard practices of sharing data and analysis methods/code, so that the research is more replicable.","3a5a75e1db40d5569b89a22dc5aa0f219b5f227abd0a08b90903a60fc3d22cb93b083272af6bae2bc044dea74a43473ed59a71f7b3a005673f40e3cae3edac04","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","33","0148bd5fb102f53e49ea90e96d2e17a619c6c6bd522f798c13c20f1b0dc42019ad496463f48cf2dc3c537a267b747d0433dec969da70d7636347d3a9b5dad00e",1540686290,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Research",2,2

As has been mentioned in some of the other comments here, there is also concerns about the 90-day out clause.May I suggest modifying this proposal to have monthly payouts of DCR, with the option for either party (the Decred stakeholders or Ditto) to terminate the relationship at the close of any given month (perhaps with a requirement of 15 or 30-day notice)? - This gives you the leeway to terminate the contract if you're no longer comfortable accepting DCR for payment.- This also gives the stakeholders an option to opt-out if expected results are not delivered. Stakeholder opt-out would be made in the form of a new Politeia proposal terminating the relationship.","3d6f7585b6085f26dc09e8c198c866d5a72038f4c2ce3d41cf42187c55e714b05ac8fea25c3771d579f6d47882ea6de0a9ac7fcff465304a1757afaf1028f50f","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","b4fba50e7b8d0f0b1d49250eca3ddad3c4e71af6b01aa159c7696ebd92921320b342ed672f584d7ae2958e56177c83998f7a41829abfb2e37d5fcf19abcc0007",1540250595,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",5,5

The majority of our clients are startups, so we understand how valuable time is.One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time.

So I will repeat the same train of thought from Wachsmans commentary: > “Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content CreationThis is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly.Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to.”From what i’ve seen at dittopr.co, the case studies are very oriented towards the statistical/reach and journalism outputs. I would be rather interested in seeing work that demonstrates more tangible outputs of creative problem solving, thought and strategic ability, and even sheer writing ability, and this being in a brands context rather than only journalism. Ideally this should relate to the expected outputs planned for Decred and have the work talk for itself. Considering the Wachsmans competitive proposal is up also, what would you consider your main edge on them? Thanks.","4327c6d713b7de22835411e927f21342ad28157be2f6290fbce4623aaac13eb19ff9779ba192a0d2b77a374398f262d62aa7fb161d77367ee5575439f52b0304","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","22","fbe144c37bdd54410c0959bc93468b8d0b74aa3039327ab65f472d017dbfc456427da2afc62a9e743d066c91c6acb975f88cf80b73599e423250f05e1133aa02",1540330293,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",2,6

We have a lot to cover from this comment. First, let me say you are asking all the right questions. We are enjoying answering all of them!“Positioning, messaging and talking points” is probably one of the most important things Ditto does for its blockchain clients. I’d add “media training,” as well.What you say and how you say it is critical to achieve what we are trying to accomplish. And from Ledger to Origin to Monero to Kadena, we spent a lot of time early on working on this. For some clients, it was more about what they say to different audiences. For other clients, it was about simply coming up with one document on “how to explain ourselves.” We’ve been doing that a lot recently. In a decentralized company, we’d like for everyone to be able to explain who they work for as similarly as possible. That is important not only for journalists, but for internal purposes, as well.A lot of the founders we work with – many, if not most, are devs – have never done an interview before. So we need to make sure that 1) they know what to say and 2) they are comfortable conducting an interview. That’s why media training is important. We want to make sure that when you talk to anyone from CoinDesk to The New York Times (which you will), you crush it.I hope that answers one part of your question.Moving on…Trey, who founded Ditto, was originally a reporter at the Associated Press. Writing will always be important at Ditto. In fact, we recently hired a VP Kris Kitto, who was also a reporter in Washington D.C. Kris oversees content at Ditto and regularly teaches the rest of us how to be a better writer. Everyone at Ditto is expected to be a good writer. That’s also because we are generalists, meaning we pride ourselves on being good at all the core tenets of PR. Ditto isn’t for everyone. There are PR people out there who JUST want to manage clients or JUST do media relations. A lot of us have some kind of specialty, but we are pretty freakin’ good at all the core communications offerings.Also, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed. I don’t want to talk too much about Wachsman, who I respect and talk to regularly, but Ditto is outspoken about what makes us different and better, and I think this is an important differentiator to point out. Our team is senior-level PR people. We don’t staff our accounts with one person who’s just good at events, and one senior person who would probably just “manage.” That’s just not how we operate… and it’s working!A bit of “how the sausage is made:” Every account is required to come up with one smart idea every month. What does that mean? It means strategic advice is mandatory at Ditto. It means that we are thinkers and doers.I wish we had time to update some of our case studies, but we’ve been busy on client work. That’s another difference between Ditto and our competitors. We are a bunch of super smart PR folks who do a ton of crypto and blockchain work. Every client is important, and every week we bust our ass to give them good counsel and get them the awareness they deserve. Big PR firms have sales people and marketing people who can create case studies on messaging to make them sound good. We just haven’t had the time to do that yet.","e4fc46d30ed2805f070aa14d9f851ee1d04a3c01118a453e09db9f00af97f554d544adfd759151d1e7b4d6f1c8b00187b7b8f7855058f14a4c85cc916251220d","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","23","342362d87853e0a9e128f535d51b701e45c9a89c6361badaa97ae001bcdaec190082885b892526e4e52c9ee78a56919fd776d123c08a882fffdcdc1a2e065008",1540342057,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",2,4

As you stated, you already have a third party (from the Decred dev team) willing to provide you with the USD portion of your proposal.Why not, simply lay out a separate contract between you and that party to process the DCR <=> USD exhange according to the terms agreed and remove the USD requirement from this proposal?Otherwise, the problem I see is that the Decred entity itself has no central authority and cannot for example, open a bank account and process USD payments.The various stakeholders like myself, who together form this decentralized entity, only have the ability to allow DCR payments from the treasury by voting on proposals. So you may find difficult to have them agree to enter a contract in which they are required to do something impossible (make payments in USD).Furthermore, as the goal is to eventually have payments made automatically using a smart contract based on votes, this kind of DCR/USD arrangements in a proposal will eventually not be possible anymore unless an intermediary makes the proposal in DCR, and then contract the services is USD.Finally one danger of leaving the proposal ""as is"", is that it leaves the impression for future proposal, that the treasury can be disbursed to contractors in USD (which is technically false and can only be achieved with a third party).","53a224b2da5ff904946ddde17b96df527d4abd71107139e4629b7601b7caa97348e85b7b60488352478e2f34a0ddfe8e346c61a47e9b0f5b591bb921021d5307","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","24","6d103862d992de73de4b9cabb67c5241dd72661910c363b92ae5596d829a4049b1a8fdcc1c61e2945ab243880d80c0a7744cdaea300d8f702e0369830f7fd101",1540342294,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",1,1

This is important to know, because how otherwise do we make use of the opt-out clause.Who is paying the Decred representatives you media train? Who selects these representatives? Will they be paid from this budget? Will event registration fees and other associated costs (like hotel, etc) that you arrange be paid from this budget?And as a more fundamental question tied to this, who are the people that are representing Decred? We have yet to see a proposal in the spirit of 'I want to represent Decred at events,' or 'this company/group of people wants to take care of event representation and presence.'Are you proposing to train Company 0 employees or freelancers or your own employees?Then as others have asked in both this proposal and the other marketing one, (why) do you think Decred needs your entire proposed suite of services for a relatively short 6-month period?","13d62bbfcd360e236e33f157c27f6cb449b160af56b1c0873205e41288bc4b6b6295b3ec2fbc9ece70315322f240fbce1632d5aa6661aaeecb5125166e66140f","00c09bb145ae4ddf1d5ec5a6a80e2697d081e8cf906600c3fca7a9f0e2dca0ab","31","53861a2da20cc0daa8f60c1d9dbd597f6e15d69ba7e89940405b9363c21f90274889cc862f49c2501ddd51232251eea244e5614eb13c524dfa7566c9a4adad09",1540469720,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",1,1

It starts by aligning on KPIs and objectives, which will be determined as part of the onboarding process. We’ve already talked about some of the objectives that the community believes are important, but we’ll want to get specific. For instance: How many pieces of coverage per month, how many pieces of content we will produce, how many events per quarter, etc.  That said, we only propose what we think a client needs.Things we think about:1) Expert sourcing – When reporters write about governance issues they should be quoting someone from Decred2) Proactive pitching – Identify monthly issues/topics relevant to Decred that will generate media coverage3) Quality vs. quantity – We want to balance top tier crypto (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, etc.) with top tier mainstream (NYT, WSJ, Laura Shin, Bloomberg)4) Decred features – What story lines provide us opportunities to get those bigger stories? We should always be thinking big.5) News announcements – Do we want to get one really good story through an exclusive, or do we reach out to a handful of reporters?Once we align in understanding where there is opportunity, we can then layout expected outputs. Ballpark, we tend to get 5-10 pieces of coverage each month for our crypto clients. Where there’s news, it’s even higher.Onboarding takes no more than 30 days, ideally. This is some of the most important foundation work we will do. This includes messaging, identifying topics/issues Decred should be talking about, looking at any upcoming announcements, news opportunities, etc. We are a results-focused PR firm, so we love outputs and deliverables.We tend to have a weekly check-in with our clients. Most of that is accountability: What have we done this week, what are we doing next week. Also, there’s some accountability on the client side: We need X and Y from you (without creating too much extra work on your end). Again, this is a partnership.What we are most eager to get to is the harder results: media coverage, securing speaking engagements, publishing op-eds, etc. One of the things our team couldn’t stand while working at bigger, global PR firms was 30, 60, 90 days into a new client, the firm was still “strategizing” and “creating memos,” but the client was like “Yeah, but where are the results??” There’s a lot of important foundational work to be done, but Ditto is always eager to “go external.”I would check with Dustin from Decred on additional fees. Things like travel and conference fees are not traditionally included in PR plans. Also, on who is representing Decred. That would be part of what we’d hope to discover during the onboarding process. The same is true for media training. Once we identify who or whom will be representing Decred from an external standpoint, we will train them on certain aspects of how to engage with the media that will hopefully ensure leads to coverage with the right message being conveyed. All media training is included in the price of the monthly agreement.","9a1bb3540602f91bc0668c686abf1a0ef53095b869f8b2f64d417551132bedcaaab2500ec74143fe3ad85dfbd0cde3b8407cced4f7aa9d55964171d89e1a0704","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","32","bd39c1c6de7bbebb08615a34e9a09c5adca7f397b3ec85c92684863869ce0d1585de8805a308ee46b4c34a330c5f935edefaf7f30b7d8489cf24889e0a868c01",1540487434,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",1,1

I wanted to cross-post and address a few other questions we’ve been getting on the Decred Slack channel for everyone's awareness.**First, what are the main differences between Wachsman and Ditto?**This is a really good and important question. As we alluded to in our proposal on Politeia, Ditto is very much an “anti-PR firm” in that we fundamentally believe the traditional business model of PR firms is broken.Firstly, everyone at Ditto has a technical level of expertise and understands the nuances of blockchain/crypto in a way that far surpasses our competitors.Secondly, we understand your culture and your community, and we share your values. We’ve worked with decentralized communities like Monero that place a premium on privacy and unanimity. We’ve listened to the feedback the community has given, and we’ve made the necessary adjustments. We understand and appreciate the unique characteristics that make the Decred community what it is, which will translate into the right kind of advice and partnership when it comes time to do the work, versus more traditional marketing tactics or buzzwords.The third and most important differentiator is results. We believe in radical honestly and transparency and will only tell you what we believe to be possible. What you see is what you get, and we’re happy to provide a synopsis of the results we’ve gotten over the years. Our vast network of reporters and the relationships we have in the media value this, as well. So when we pitch a story or reach out to a journalist, they know and appreciate the companies that work with Ditto are of the highest legitimacy and credibility.Finally, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed (more on that in a bit).**Next question: Can you justify the 5k extra that Ditto is asking for compared to Wachsman?**As outlined in our conversations with the Decred community prior to this process, the fee matches the proposed scope of work. Content, media relations, conferences/events, thought leadership, and the amount of time and resources we would devote to this led us to $25K in DCR. If it is determined that the community only wants content and media relations, as opposed to conferences and events, we can adjust the proposal and the price accordingly. I also want to point out that both our CEO Trey Ditto and myself — the two most senior people at Ditto — will staff the account and give you personalized attention.**Next question: I see you have a Monero as one of your clients. Someone asked Ricardo his involvement with ditto and he mentioned that he worked with your company on a personal level not with Monero. Could you please elaborate.**We worked with Monero around their Project Coral Reef announcement, and we were subsequently hired by Tari, a project by Ric and Naveen. That, to us, indicates that they were pleased with the level of service we provided and hired us for a launch announcement that was widely covered. It’s worth noting, like with a lot of clients, we do know Ric on a personal level, as well. We are partners with our clients. By the way, here’s [an article]( http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/crypto-blockchain-monero-ticketfly-project-tari/) we generated in Fortune for the Tari announcement and here’s [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#1955c93060eb) we generated in Forbes for Monero. There we of course multiple other outlets that covered this news.  **And finally: Would you be able to provide a list of Ditto team members who we can expect to interact with on a daily basis?**The Ditto team members who would interact with you on a regular basis are the ones listed in our proposal: our CEO Trey Ditto, Managing Director Blain Rethmeier, Vice President Margaret Huang, Account Executive Milvian Prieto, and Associate Vice President Liz Bagot.","1e00a6419d34f50b3471688092ebc0c3b95482f18387ec51a14000be7579e21c9b8c3563d38041f859475bfa95f931ef9ff7e151d335dabfffa2dc347f7f6a02","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","33","b3f9a71a0b810e70ddbb3d4731bf9a6fef8382667394db6224286b116e2e7e785a1f37508748f0ea094eacd4123bc14c548dd21e3fa67d2e85f1d7efdb4cd50a",1540494071,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",2,2

But if we are being honest, one of the reasons Ditto and Wachsman are the top two crypto PR firms out there is because of our results. Top tier results are what we have in common! That’s good news for Decred.So, [here’s a smattering of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPcDM7hjwgNDxlkQOmZ3ChW2EQzbtBl6wpHZZk4_1Mo/edit?usp=sharing) we’ve secured for some of crypto clients over the past year. We chose the past year as the timeframe because we want to show that we didn’t just have a lucky couple of weeks — this is month over month consistency and delivering on what we promised. And we chose a handful of clients and just a sampling of coverage because that should show you that media coverage is one of the things we are good at.But even in the past week, clients have had features in everything from _CoinDesk_ to _SF Business Times_ to _Bloomberg TV_ to _Breaker Magazine_ to _The Block_. We could be here all day just going through “media hits”!When I look at our list and Wachsman’s list, there are a few differences: Ditto has a much more robust mix of national TV, top tier crypto, and top tier mainstream. Don’t get me wrong — there are some Tier 2/3, but our coverage seems a little more elevated.Also, the final thing I’d add, just looking at Wachsman’s coverage, is that they have a lot of stories written by contributors, whereas we tend to work directly with staff reporters. One, working directly with reporters means more people will read the story. Two — and we aren’t saying this is the case — but a lot of contributors are pay-to-play. That’s just not our style.In the interest of moving beyond just getting clients hits, there’s a backstory to every time a client is in the news. What went into that?1)    **Being proactive** – Ditto saw a trend in the industry and positioned the client2)    **Important issues** – Clients have issues/topics (community, scaling, speed, security, etc.), and we keep them in the news on those issues3)    **Messaging** – We put in the time to make sure we are relaying to the media the clients’ stories in a way that ensures positive coverage4)    **Talking Points** – Before any interview, we think about, “What do we want to say in this specific interview to get our point across?”5)    **Media training** – Could be as simple as a quick mock interview the day before, but we make sure the client is as ready as possibleSo, while we can just look at volume and quality, at Ditto, there’s a lot more care that goes into what ends up being printed.","0421a68e06a351ba0c62a1d7d7f56480859b99f1da69577769664e0ce2e71eb76186368917c218f5ecfc531d1c023e636e97fac0ae3a4fd8363797d53501ed0a","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","34","63c686853241c4a50ce57307743fac459d1ca7eb3e806cace415d4472afec00972c02321731d2fd3c190c8188f1d0dca0c0362a72e12ee5c596d67251bcf030b",1540503319,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",1,3

You made an important point, and something we try to achieve in our work: Whatever we do should tie back to an objective or a goal. We will need to work with the community to determine which specific metrics Decred wants to impact so that we can measure them — and this is something we will want to determine at the very beginning of our relationship.The plan we laid out focuses on community growth and engagement by raising your visibility, elevating your brand and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences.Metrics aside, there is something to be said about overall “awareness.” Many of our clients who have never done PR before say “We just want the community to know about us more.” And a lot of that work is targeting devs and the crypto community. It’s hard to measure awareness, although we utilize a few platforms to gauge traction of stories. And we are constantly monitoring what is and isn’t working and making adjustments.Regarding timing, we can’t think of a better time than now. Politeia is live, and we’re at the very beginning of a revolution. PR now will help drive awareness, facilitate development, and increase awareness of future Decred updates. It’s important to get started as early as possible — especially now that the product is live and working, and real proposals are being written and voted on.

Every month client teams come together and set their metrics that align with each client. Every account is different, but it basically includes: quantity and quality of media coverage, content written and published and one what we call an “extended communication” (social media, speaking, award submission, partnership, etc.). As we have said in other comments, we believe in going much farther than outputs, which we are really good at. We also measure quality of service. Every account has to come together and send the client one “smart idea” each month. This pushes us to be creative, proactive and always trying something new. The best feedback we got once was from Avi Flombaum, co-founder of Flatiron School: Every month Ditto sent us a new idea, pushing us to stay ahead. We didn’t act on many of them, which was more an internal thing on our end, but it showed us that Ditto understood our business and was always thinking about us. Finally, we have a “client facing” section, meaning we should be talking to the client on a personal and professional level every month. Again, we are your partner! Our internal metrics – which Trey has to approve – are historically higher than what the client expects. Here’s the fun part: Every team that does all these things: hits their outputs, sends a creative idea and interacts with the client gets a bonus at the end of the month.It’s why Ditto is a better PR firm. We believe in doing high quality, high output work and then rewarding staffers for doing killer work.Examples of interactions. First, I’m happy to put you in touch with Avi from Flatiron School. They were a client for 4 years – until WeWork bought them. It’s the perfect example of Ditto:1) Lifelong partners – As I said above, it was a deep partnership where we cared about them and vice versa. Trey and Avi became best friends in fact.2) Month over month results – for 4 years, they averaged 100+ stories every year.3) High quality – They were front page WSJ, Business Section B1 of NYT, on national TV 4+ times a year.4) Results attached to business – When we got them coverage, website traffic spiked and sign-ups happened.5) Positioning – Flatiron School went from maybe #4 coding bootcamp in the country to #1 based on our work and their high quality service.We have crypto examples too:- [CoinList](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/coinlist/)- [Monero](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/monero/)We need to do some more crypto case studies. Just been too busy doing PR work than marketing ourselves. Hopefully you understand we balance strategy, quality, quantity and client relations better than anyone else.We would set Decred targets in our onboarding meeting. Something super easy to set now is Decred will be interviewed and get media coverage in the top crypto and mainstream publications. From _CoinDesk_ to _New York Times_ to Laura Shin's podcast, we can promise that Decred will gain recognition in all top tier outlets. We are confident about this because all of our clients (as you saw in our media coverage examples) get this attention. For events, we’d like to see Decred have an elevated presence. This means speaking at the high-quality crypto conferences. This does NOT mean having booth babes and going to conferences that are a waste of time.","4d36bf83c7bb5e9a107f6a1420120a157dc2f3045dc3e4d4bb49942fe3d5ca366ffd48ea039bb26042a25481326543d29f2c0a6c3b2740f961b098e945540405","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","38","520cfcb25e268dba89dfe0d62777b4f4f64acf75fa0f1ca45bd8985498cef65d183d9cad8a480f1b07b96a77ac425ae563ffa04dff8b511db016f76f4abcf10e",1540680285,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Ditto",2,2

Trey answered this on Reddit and our counsel is that we don’t believe you need two PR firms. But we have worked with other PR firms with other clients in the past (typically the other firm has a very specific focus separate from ours), and it worked out.2.    We think creating materials that have maximum utility is important and sharing is going to be important to this campaign — and there will definitely be times where we should get the Decred community’s insight.3.    We do quite a bit of work in Asia — we have a couple of Chinese clients, just finished helping launch Ledger’s Hong Kong office, and have helped facilitate interviews in Chinese. Additionally, we have relationships with the Russian media. I think once we get a good work flow going and we earn your trust and prove ourselves, we should as quickly as possible add that on. A lot of the U.S. media is translated and read by China, Japan, Korea, Russia, etc.4.    You’re right — there is so much noise at conferences and events. A lot of our clients don’t even have the budget – or desire – to pay to play. We should definitely think about how to “hijack” a conference and develop an ""anti-event"" strategy.  5.    Trey also just touched on this on Reddit. I think much of the work we will do will better define Decred and elevate awareness of Decred within the Dev community. But at some point, we have to think of more direct ways to get in front of devs. That will definitely be part of our campaign, and we’d want to listen and talk to you all to figure out the best way to do it.6.

I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.If we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months.

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  We have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. The only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. The cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. I recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally.

I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive ""brand in a box"" subscription service.A lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.I don't think we need to pay for positive media.

I was one DCR team members listening in on the presentation call. My impression with Wachsmans brief presentation was positive, as they focused on quite real practicalities and describing a methodical way of doing things (on PR and Events fronts) rather than attempting to sell the project based on past clients rep. or vague promises. As a designer, i'm very considerate about the optics and how different actions effect the reputation of the project. I'm largely in favour of the proposal, as it's mostly sound and proportionate in the ways it relates to these matters. Afaik there is not a conflict of interest with their other crypto clients, as there's different employees assigned to these projects, nevertheless this needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts. In response to some comments preferring only the current ""grass-roots"" approach and fears around giving off so called ""corporate vibe"" – these cases should not be looked at in a black and white manner. Decred needs a solid PR & events output and professional presence just as much as it needs the friendly enthusiasts and community hotheads. One does not have to conflict the other. I would imagine worse future outcomes if DCR happens to lack on the professional front – as then it simply may not be taken seriously and get the foot through the door when needed. One must not forget, this is a financial product after all. To give an illustrated example, quoting one of my past critiques around overusing and turning the spaceman jacket into a bad gimmick if presented wrong context: “I am an investor or a person working at relevant business/institution visiting a conference with aim to connect with xyz crypto projects – see a number of professional and respectable looking talkers. Last talk is Decred. I don’t know what Decred is yet. See someone looking like a clown come to the stage. Red flag hits, leave before it starts as the first impression is ruined and i’ve got better things to do.” First impression one won’t get to re-do. There are certain marketing and PR approaches that are fundamentally incompatible with DCR imo, for example: deeply sales oriented and high-pressure sales tactics; ""fishsalesmen type"" hype/spam campaigns relying on overpromising, dumbing down; dishonest, misleading or very clickbaity communications for content or campaign advertising, all kind of referral/multi-level marketing schemes. I don't think any of these are present here.**Media Training + Speaker positioning** This service should certainly be focused on. Correct me if i'm wrong, but in the long term DCR will need many topnotch spokespersons rather than relying primarily on Jake and Marco, as neither wish to build images of a central figures. Ideally this service can be leveraged to help train existing community members up, to be better enquipped for the role. Meaning DCR will in the long run have many adept spokespersons. Giving presentations and interviews is simply another skill that can always be improved through work and training. I find it negligible if situation occurs where people who are untrained or with little to no experience end up giving presentations, interviews etc about the project.**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation**This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly. Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to. To wrap things up, my questions are: - Can you elaborate on this item, your process and the deliverables output for this work? - Do you plan on involving more talent to cover this front? Thanks.","ed11f934b4e1583f599e0293cc52b9c3a69035c55c2c8a58ef6c2b1c35d6c98d1b4b47a99a4d90c7c1a8fb5090d6aa90210bf8fb4e588db3597b72a989f95508","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","18","25479acadcb07901f0e2bf6e31e3dad347a655c357037fae9e84c102431798f24d0d56a49b37b3e075fafccec228f74b3ab83fe402edec81cb2da98fd0a9e704",1540223542,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",-1,7

The fact that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase isn’t just a major draw for us — it’s a notion that we anticipate will be exceptionally (and justifiably) well-received by the media as well. This is especially true for the more “mainstream” reporters, many of whom will honestly just hang up the phone if they hear “ICO” or “Token Sale.” > We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver.Very, very good call here. This would absolutely be our recommendation as well. Wachsman’s goal is never to merely promote hype around a project, it is to demonstrate to the wider blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mainstream communities the inherent value propositions of our clients in a non-hyperbolic way. Wachsman endeavors to act as a megaphone through which Decred’s message can be heard by a greater audience, bringing those with whom this message resonates with into the community. >  In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. While we completely understand the importance of maintaining decentralization, from a media (and events) standpoint we feel that it is exceptionally important for there to be at least one — but likely more depending on the communications vertical — advocate/ambassador that is available and media trained to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors (it is my understanding that we will be doing media training for 6+ individuals, but are more than happy to offer it to more people, as needed). This is exceptionally important when it comes to communication verticals like thought leadership/ expert commentary. Wachsman has mainstream reporters reaching out to us daily for quick commentary, and the ability to have an established representative from Decred readily available to turn around initial thoughts on breaking news is hugely beneficial for securing coverage. We anticipate that during our engagement we will work closely with the Decred community as a whole, but in the interest of keeping Decred on people’s radar outside of major announcements, suggest a strong media presence for select team members at least in the immediate future.","4418dfa696e3b15a14ac1d9a2a5833fdf27f3111ee65e09adaa2da25a1adccac25b588e25635eb1193337a9520b6a1bf0443973784d23b8b7996fc9ae7b96408","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","20","a9aa2336fadcca1cc62a61f0a0d151d3ff04a3f68e07cc72827a5b73bfed2ac866ed7ad0d9c8927b0ec70781b52da0f784d476fc4f9464679feb8ecc00a9b90a",1540232829,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",2,2

Wachsman will never pay for media placements for our clients, nor will we deploy advertising budgets. We strongly believe that the best way to generate brand awareness and exposure is through organic media exposure based primarily on the core value propositions of our clients, and the communication of these value propositions to the relevant members of the media in a strategic and measured manner. Wachsman are true admirers of the community Decred has built as well as the values on which it was built upon, and we would never tarnish these values by offering Decred a “brand in a box” proposal. What we endeavor to do is to magnify the achievements already made by the Decred community, and the achievements which Decred will undoubtedly make in the future by communiticating them to the world in the correct manner, a manner which is in line with these founding values and the long term goals and ambitions of Decred.> With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.This is certainly true to an extent, and congratulations are definitely in order given the project’s success to date. It is our firm belief, however, that given the amazing growth of the project so far - and all the significant milestones to come - Decred deserves a robust expansion of media coverage. What Decred is doing is truly exceptional and you have all worked hard to get here — ** everyone ** should know about it!Furthermore, it is worth stressing the value of a strategic approach to media, as opposed to one that is merely reactive and ad hoc. There is immense value in controlling your narrative and having news come from you — not just being about you and out of your control. Wachsman has spent years developing unmatched relationships with media (both in trade and mainstream) and as such is uniquely suited to navigate the media landscape, knowing when and which reporters to offer select pitches and announcements to — ultimately striving to have more control over when and what things are said about Decred and how the project is positioned by the media.","e70bd21e5994c60cb67cd472796209d2d78a8f636038e60656ce4388b41c0b706527845e1d84d6670efd1610fa91d50a09b3e32bc5bf9fe5bd3f77ca25e5f302","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","21","af4ea34f93286db0b83c2cb376535a52a51f24955fbc6e2bab68b13d14a112041e77ce00d51fcfcda677911a609d61002ec7f7c9c577d3978b345ab019ba050c",1540233005,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",3,3

I do consider the copywriter(s) on the task largely responsible for the creative output and assume it would be preferred from Decred team’s end to have them involved closely.","fd427d73622541b5c3dd7ef402455aa53a6926441fabdf314f6b1bc285a5d06bb389e3d2ad25be6dac4042a01fbb805ed58ee5a9a61c88ff532a4ae0d4f6c001","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","41","e7158429702117f6f3a2f10a8565544fdca502dc65a93697311c62708b211c24793f3f1905440cde436eb019c27040af7624c409c6974a08e121d994abc01c04",1540327238,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",0,4

We have seen time and time again with the company’s coming to us from other firms that it’s the only way you can service blockchain projects. Decred’s representatives, community, and developers are working tirelessly to do all the work you mentioned and more. None of this succeeds if we have to give you more work because we don’t have a big enough or experienced enough or committed enough team in place to service Decred. Take our events support for instance — the main reason that we began offering it to clients is because we saw many dedicating a ton of time to navigating the 700 plus crypto events (not to mention hundreds of events we can support you with in other verticals, like mainstream finance or tech) that come into their inboxes a year. With Wachsman, Decred’s representatives and community essentially won’t have to worry about anything related to events coordination other than booking flights and hotels. Speaker pitches, negotiating pricing with organizers, booth set up, even SWAG coordination — we’re taking it off your plate.The very first thing that Wachsman would do when Decred comes on is have a full kickoff call with the community-chosen representatives of the project (on a conference call that you’re all more than welcome to listen in on). This kickoff call (frankly it’s a brain dump) lets our team get extremely well versed in the project, its timeline, its needs, hopes for positioning in the media, and more. We learn your project inside and out so that we can bring it to reporters and events organizers without needing to go back and forth to your team, slowing down the process and making more work for you. Our efforts will always look to highlight the amazing work of your team — not burden it.","9defff8d89de63bbd3f763ce84078c2767e71ce6de5722a4049459c41138f798fde61bd85968813aa0d95e4621578fcf25a0d9db56254f11e03f470c62f40908","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","42","87558cd513415d4fcaa456870eb5ab1874b481ad737f47fc98a903443d98bc90cb63355f2f25257cfb6b5f04b2903a2162b4a52509ed9af37c4c21cd5537db09",1540393293,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",2,2

If so, do you have an estimate?2> Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.3> Crisis Communications (...) limiting reputational impactInteresting, I'd love to understand this better. Say we have an incident, like a 12 hour network stall, or a serious vulnerability discovered. What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?4 Looking at your connections, do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?5 Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.6 Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?7 Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?8 Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?9 Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?10 Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?11 List of clients in the portfolio is impressive but only contains short descriptions of clients. Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? Like a simple per-client list of actions taken, with some result analysis. linnutee asked a similar question with no reply so far.12 How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?13 Why some of the linked articles feature Blockfolio and Ethereum while they are not in the list of clients? Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'?14 Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)15 Are the payments monthly?16 Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Or, alternatively, slowly ramp up the expenses based on deliverables. Asked a few times but answer so far.17 In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?18 Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?19 In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?20 linnutee mentioned legal contracts, which contracts and with whom will be made?On the text itself:1. Please avoid using tracking bits in the links, e.g. `#1716b3851e51` in the forbes.com link or the `utm_xxx` in coindesk.com links. Anti-privacy tracking links are bad in general, but are even worse for a site that is visited by stakeholders.2. `11.01.18 — 05.01.19`: please use international date format, month before day is [US-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country). By the way a good PR direction is to make Decred look less US-centric.3. Small and totally my personal issue: the ""industry experts"" and ""leaders"" are the ""business speak"" terms that are abused to the point they _lower_ credibility for me.

Generally, is there any funding that may be required from Decred on top of this proposal's budget? If so, do you have an estimate?Signing with Wachsman means Decred does not have to worry about hiring an events team - we would cover you across the board from screening events, applying for speaking opportunities for your chosen representatives, helping with booth set up and ordering SWAG and more. The only thing Decred would have to worry about would be paying for the flights, hotel rooms, and tickets to the events themselves (although we are extremely good at securing discounts). For Decred specific events (hackathons, roadshows, etc.) we offer full support there as well.> If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.Ideally Jake would be one of many representatives - based on their area of expertise (i.e. a lead developer to talk to developer press). In a perfect world, a decentralized project wouldn’t have any centralized spokespeople - but in the current media and events landscape, they would be needed to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors. That said, Wachsman would work extremely hard to protect the decentralized nature of Decred -- it’s one of your best selling points and speaks to the very reason this industry was started in the first space! We would do this by working very closely with the community.> What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?There would be two main buckets here that would fall under our “rapid-response” engagement. 1. Manage, contain, and minimize negative publicity related to Decred, while developing a crisis strategy, contingency plan, and pre-approved drawer statements to prevent and mitigate any potential future crises. 2. Generate ongoing and regular content to strategically pitch Decred to media to ladder down negative articles about the network stall in organic searches. When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this) examples of crises that Wachsman is prepared to help mitigate include: platform/token hacks, regulatory intervention, subpoena requests, unfulfilled company promises, staff departures, technology flaws, investor withdrawals, token offering extensions, sharp declines in token value, social media account takeovers, security breaches, and consistent community/developer/media criticisms.> Do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?You can be the best project in the industry and be excluded from the media landscape entirely without the right team in place to change that. The bar for coverage in CoinDesk (a Wachsman client) has risen significantly in recent months - but we’re well prepared to navigate that (including suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo). > Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.Agreed 100 percent on the value of growing a developer base and there are several levers we can pull there. 1. A tailored media campaign to the publications we know developers are more likely to read. 2. A tailored events campaign to get Decred at the events we know developers are going to (including ones with job fairs) and supporting Decred in rolling out their own organic events - like hackathons for example. 3. Leveraging Wachsman’s Strategic Advisory Group that does this all the time. We didn’t list them in the day-to-day team members that will be supporting Decred because we didn’t want to misrepresent who will be supporting Decred daily, but this is an area that they would be well suited to help you with. As a bit of a background on them, they are headed up by Michael Chang and Franklin Bi. Michael previously served as Senior Vice President at Jefferies investment bank where he led the blockchain coverage effort. Prior to joining Wachsman, Franklin led the Blockchain Strategy group at JP Morgan. He helped lead the Quorum initiative and co-founded the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, among many other achievements. > Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?One of the biggest focuses in hiring in our Singapore office has been fluency in other languages. While we focus primarily on English speaking media, we are well (and uniquely) suited to pitch Decred in other languages - we would likely rely on translation services for full releases however. > Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?Yes, absolutely. Decred’s community is one of the most important pillars of the project - we would look to include it across the board throughout this campaign. > Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?While (hopefully) this would not be part of our day to day activities, we would leverage our rapid response and crisis communications team to guide Decred through instances like this. > Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?That’s a fantastic idea and certainly something we could look to do in the interest of keeping Decred’s community members as involved as possible. > Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?Yes; happy to. > Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? There is more info [attached in this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11v242zQ3bhj3aDaoKM7ZsrKexRIsqwA4Aez4mzXnQAw/edit#slide=id.g46600410e6_0_0) that goes into a bit more detail the nature of our campaigns. Happy to elaborate on any specific use cases. > How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?In terms of the linked articles, Wachsman focuses entirely on “earned media” meaning we leveraged our relationships with reporters and industry knowledge to generate pitches that we then presented to individual reporters based on their interests who then generated organic content of their own based on it.","2f3417508e5816f5238b6181028ee2ecf124b55306106c992bab775d37a018d98bc883f4d9d5935dbf368050c9a034730bfdc25ac5c5429bd33169828fcded0b","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","70","118262eae35780fd360c095fa554e862e34c5361414615fc422c25f6e92bbbb9eada2a7cab0126b0db84420566addd813396a0bcae7c899250bad15686b4aa0a",1540912904,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",2,2

Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'?These would fall under the idea of “expert commentary” -- leveraging industry trends or larger stories to insert commentary that further establishes Decred’s chosen representatives as wider industry experts -- not just Decred experts. This both keeps Decred regularly in the news and further establishes your representatives/Decred as one of the best and most experienced teams in the industry. > Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)No, we have not. > Are the payments monthly?Yes, they would be monthly.> Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Yes, we have a standard 30 day out clause specifically to ensure stakeholders remain in control there. Frankly though, I would be shocked if you chose to use that clause. > In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?Yes, absolutely - that would be supported by the aforementioned Strategic Advisory Group. > Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?Not to my knowledge, but we would be supportive of the idea of doing so for all future calls in the interest of keeping Decred's community as informed as possible. > In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?Wachsman has worked with other PR firms in the past when our offerings were complimentary - working with a firm that focuses exclusively on Korean speaking media or reporters in the art vertical for example. In terms of working with another firm in the same space, I would have to echo Ditto's thoughts there - it would likely be redundant. > Which contracts and with whom will be made?Can you elaborate on this question?","60b14941466fa072f7ce3bc121d2a887f290ffe81d2d3696d84573823de40e2be0d8a439c9c1c59c1ba49761f22449cf179196ddfdd031eb4a0643bbeeacbc0a","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","71","b2767f8d7029a5ef10df407c34133c825288803f97f2b063962060285490645ce783f5c8bd91e3cd1ac1a0f923f54c7321203c0bbd013b5b0786da5dbf6cbf0f",1540912912,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Wachsman",1,1

As seen [here](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=127080&rows=40), block 127072 was mined 9 hours after its parent. It was due to a sudden spike in hashrate, which is a good thing. Delayed transactions are not cool, but they were the only problem. All core software behaved as expected.Cryptocurrencies do have incidents, post-mortems are openly published, and personally I find them as a good way to know the projects better by watching how their teams react. For example, the [report](https://www.dash.org/2017/03/08/DDoSReport.html) of the DoS attack on DASH left a good impression: the issue was handled rather fast, a report was posted, and a message saying ""there are people out there monitoring all the time"" conveyed.> suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargoEmbargo?> Can you elaborate on this question?

Correct, a lot of crisis communications includes minimizing coverage of the story as much as possible - or at the very least getting ahead of it so that when incidents do go public, like the DoS attack on DASH, we can control the narrative around those incidinents. Part of that minimizing coverage as much as possible means that we would do our best to prevent it from being brought up again at a later date — and as such wouldn't use it in public discussions down the line. > Embargo?A lot of mainstream reporters — particularly those in this industry — won't go near news that has already been ""broken,"" meaning if a story about Politeia going live has already been picked up by a number of the smaller trade outlets, they won't go near them. With stories of this nature, Wachsman would bring the news to a very selected (and trusted) number of reporters in the space that we know will not break the story early. This allows major reporters to do their dilligence, have interviews with relevant parties, and fold coverage into their own editorial calendars ahead of us distributing the news far and wide at a pre-selected date. An example of this was eToro's launch into the United States. The Wachsman PR and Events teams worked for several weeks under embargo with top-tier reporters so that when Yoni Assia was on stage at Consensus announcing that they were launching in the American crypto market, several top tier articles went live at the exact same time.> Separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contractsNot a problem.

DCR is already available for on Easyrabbit it seems, and the relatively small price for the ""upgrade"" comes with some real benefits to Decred, which do come at a cost to this exchange.

Specifically, (1) widget integration and (2) lower fees for users, come at a cost to the exchange and have obvious benefits to users of DCR.  Arguably, this is true for social media promotion where there's only so much room for tweets about the coins they support.

On the other hand, paying to put the DCR logo in their ""featured section"" is arguably of less value and feels a bit against our values.  Is that different from social media promotion?  Maybe not much, but the reach of social media is important for informing/reminding those already interested in DCR that there is another service they can use.  But featured placement on their homepage does not seem necessary if you come to the site already knowing what you want to do (hopefully buy DCR).

What can go wrong with this proposal? ""Constant promotion"" sounds a bit like spam everyone all the time.  Also, the mere acceptance of this proposal could reflect poorly, if it weren't for the redeeming fact that 30 DCR is a modest sum that is actually appropriate for the added services.

My first thoughts on such listing fee propositions have to do with understanding if the exchange actually has justification for the fee.

A regular exchange asking a listing fee just to list an asset, when fees from that assets trading bring profit to the exchange, is a huge red flag for me.  They should list the coin anyway since the alternative is to get no profit at all (this is what most respectable exchanges seem to do).

What I see here is an exchange that has already listed the asset and is offering a lowered fee among other things.  Now, it is a valid question to ask if the initial fees were already too high, or if the lowered fees are lowered enough.","39283014355dc59fededa67229b1a6445c453641c1cd2b8314cc02b6232a54831612caafe721464f3aa63c09c2789e36332e885e7990f0af22f7c4e539d40505","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","10","4eb3403593af1ecfa18dffed082aeb1ce72a2eea7e1da637dbdb7c1d6761718e6305bcece39a4c2e38ea00bb3bd20659a1c7b0ac41094e9055b57cb344996b00",1541036762,0,0,FALSE,NA,"Easyrabbit",1,1

On the content,  I believe this is an horrible idea.... GPUs are more vulnerable to large ""Chinese"" mining farms because there is far less risk to build a GPU farm than using ASICs.  With a GPU farm you can change the coin you mine as often as you want, and even resell the hardware for it's real purpose (gaming). You don't really have skin in the game.

With an ASICs farm,  you can only mine one coin, you cannot resell easily, the risk is higher to get stuck with that hardware. You are quite a bit more invested in the currency you mine.

Maybe the only moment that argument would hold IMO is when a coin is already exclusively mined on GPUs and a new ASIC could be made in secret and take over.  However  in an well established coin like Decred where we have multiple ASICs manufacturers and a strong governance system which can keep miners in check I see this suggestion as an immense step back in security.","42014516845f978fef58ff9e1b3963006fb2e3d8191803cf865087af251c3cbd1171528ebf19a759389f9444b0eaceec1d1811e6621b92dcd5568d685b5f200f","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","2","b63c6ac83c325b6cfcc47ec43d1b9d9a27bfebf9156f193dc76eed4b598cdd552a3ab537819fbdf52869d7cc439397e088636dfd35ccd98a391e138c5cbfb603",1542045691,0,0,FALSE,NA,"ProgPoW",8,8

1-No algorithm is truly ASIC-resistant
2-The coin emission rate depletes at a rate that makes early holders diluted anyway

Because of the hybrid PoW/PoS system, it's roughly 20X more expensive to 51% attack, according to recent analysis. This means ASICs pose less risk. In fact, there is a strong argument they increase security, as the increased hashrate they provide, paired with PoS voting, increases the total cost to 51% attack. There could be a possible danger if there was only one or two ASIC manufacturers mining in secret, centralizing nearly all the hashpower. However, the Decred team, perhaps seeing this danger, signaled that they were ASIC friendly from the start, resulting in like half a dozen (or more) ASICs from different manufacturers coming to market, leading to decentralization within the ASIC mining community. 

Also, while I appreciate that this important issue is raised, it seems clear to me from Decred comm channels (slack, telegram, reddit, medium, etc.) that the vast majority of the community is ASIC friendly.

This could in effect make Decred the lowest barrier to entry ""masternode"" (though that term is not exactly accurate, it's close enough).

I have a couple of concerns/things to think about:1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics & corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.    On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.3. > These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.    That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.    This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.","2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e",1540044035,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",12,12

As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.For example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.**From proposal:**> It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.In my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. If left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.Having 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.For example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.3. Sub-ContractorsI totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.4.

This will hopefully also be sobering in regards of keeping up responsibility what time and funds are spent on as well help with enforcing quality standards.","057da38b01f90e1f99189e94291c816e845ea271d68ecc899d8848b50bd09965af43acf8cca75b4b84a65938bb8b57df9bc1a321bf352fc40d4e2ac79f477c05","67160ece43ebd1dfb6ae4c68d5772449bf9c47d39289c2a218768d02c4bebc7c","15","59a994aa0a6ca48e510bd1ce5c121965104f88f6468045d69ea90da68476edbace3a0183a4aff6e3f915dd042bd22d0a14f7e4e3aa8257403fa73f4533699108",1540059972,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",5,7

In several cases, outright termination was the only real option for contractors who were overbilling and under-delivering.1. Per my response to ryanzim, every system can be gamed.  There is an escalation process that can address punitive or self-interested actions.  The current system where I mediate these conflicts, or where they are mediated by some other person or group, are also vulnerable to gaming.  Even in the design subdomain where you do some of your work, there are several groups performing work, not just one entity.  This diversity applies to most subdomains, AFAICR.  Corporate contractors only having a single vote creates a substantial incentive against being a corporate contractor, whereas every individual DCC holder being able to vote reflects the skin-in-the-game more accurately.2. Regarding working in multiple subdomains, I think that it could make sense to allow for a DCC to apply to one or more subdomains, and partial revocations to occur.  It would also make sense for a multi-subdomain contractor to be allowed to vouch in their corresponding subdomains, but their all-contractor vote would be handled the same way as everyone else's.3.

Elected officials may one day be required for smaller roles that are just inefficient to manage otherwise,  but for something as important as vetting contractors, we should stay clear of it as much as we can.Having a central point of authority on a subject imply setting him up as a single point of failure. Even if the elected individual is fair and responsible, if conflict arise with a contractor, the official becomes a single point of frustration for this contractor.  And then it's easy to feel wronged and have the accusations start flying to have this one person replaced even though he may have acted  objectively.When the responsibility falls to a group of multiple contractors there will of course be situation where conflict will occur,  but I believe we remove quite a lot of the possible drama and followup issues.","a42f357c78e3a9260e844633362ffe4ac89b15595d4ca459fa28ac2533f7935cd7816b71b397ab86210b1fc5be7bed5447fe178f92223221f1f4b8b3b8ca4b09","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","31","2061e0b5ed22cc0b97f5eba23b77adc21e5b1eee1c1d4ea734757e17bdd8cf119a09f3cea00ccc7ed2305b0c4d79fde27d43032bd4890cfe0c486274e7b7720c",1540130468,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",2,2

Given all else that has been discussed I'm guessing no, but this should be made explicit: the process of obtaining a DCC is different than joining one of the existing core development teams (from which you can bill and whose budget will be discussed in a different proposal) and/or getting approval for participation in a particular proposal which would allow the originating entity (either an independent contractor or a corporate contractor) to actually bill for that particular proposal.My concern is making explicit the dynamics for development teams/companies, the goals of the DCC system in particular and, more broadly, the high level goals of Politeia and the DAE.I should contextualize that I'm from a country with somewhat strong worker protection laws, in which it's expensive to hire, maintain and terminate worker contracts, any given company can be easily sued for (improper, even if non intentional) worker compensation and (usually) loses those suits. And in full disclosure, I'm also trying to bring in some new developers following the proposed format for the DCCs.Therefore I'll use a hypothetical example to tease out some of these concerns: Development shop Alpha (that currently does not have DCC holding employees) wants to propose a given software. Let's assume the idea itself is sound, well accepted and the team is generally regarded as competent at a first glance.So now, the team from Alpha will have to get DCCs in order for the proposal to be put up for voting. Alpha itself (assuming it's a standard consulting business) will bear the cost for the work performed by their employees while acquiring the DCC. These developers will then be eligible for participation in Alpha's proposal.Now, will Alpha's devs be able to directly bill for work performed (outside the context of Alpha's proposal)? Or will there be a separate process from which they'll have to join one of the existing core teams (possibly incidentally terminating their employment contract with Alpha)?I assume this sort of situation will only be answerable in time, as we get more experience with Politeia and evolve the DAE. But we should make it explicit if the system is designed to be contractor-centric (a dev getting a DCC while working for a corporate contractor is only granted it as it relates to that corporation's proposals) or DCC-holder-centric (once you get a DCC, it's personally yours whether you remain in the contractor that ""sponsored"" you or not - and corporate contractors should have that in mind when hiring, training and maintaining employees).","c1eb060d262206df4358f3febcd325d66f5739bc18752477684b2230478d806baf7f1b04af5d8f22680355e9ca6252013c824d741c804614cb2fda1fb3b04502","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","33","848c7e9bd0a381f0662e57545d858d6a4ce0fe197c07f715d77226dc7cc3de9dbc135d87c4cc6dd00b79461e63b6619ab647660ddaa676c78c19fae134790a06",1540211214,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",6,8

""work constructively within their subdomain"" is quite subjective.3. I was just thinking it might be good to include a statement in the proposal condemning corporate vote manipulation and recommending a penalty be enforced.  I realize we can't make this code-enforced, but I was thinking along the lines of how the Decred Constitution states the 21 million supply limit. There's nothing that actually prevents an on-chain vote from modifying that limit, but most stakeholders would be opposed to it since it runs contrary to the Constitution. Likewise, if we make a recommendation of penalizing corporate vote manipulation in this proposal, it's highly likely that an all-contractor vote (or stakeholder vote) will enforce this recommendation.","dd03dc7e55ef90539635b1b1e438d95e0d79c9812433699d6b25f768a27ed3df5d78f8f7ca4f2f87496fdb55d6cda2a835f62f7c1afc245f947de8fbeb09fd02","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","34","44633da62af91308893d0fc193e9a164cd4e6b56d3e9a2b0ef3ed8d026ab48a39b5aef2e2acf99c10e5d7cd8543c8b651efcc78b1295dfc5a2152654208b0603",1540247684,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",3,3

The existing process (show up, do, apply), is great. It's how employment should work, IMO. However, it requires a large leap of faith on the part of potential contractors. People have to invest a significant amount of time and energy up front, with no guarantee of being paid. From Decred's perspective, this is totally reasonable. Prospective contractors require a significant investment from Decred, in the form of time and energy spent onboarding, reviewing work, training, etc., with no guarantee of getting valuable work in return. The current materials around becoming a contractor (docs, blogs, etc.) express all this very well, along with the ethos of the project. In the end, it worked out for me. I'm psyched to be able to commit more to the project. However, I can see how this process could exclude many talented people who either can't handle the higher levels of uncertainty, or who have fewer financial resources than I do. If there was a system like the one proposed, and it actually works as intended, I think my journey would have been less stressful, and probably more productive. I also like the idea of having more visibility into the hiring/firing process moving forward. Indeed, it's my first month. I could still not work out and not have my contract renewed (no hard feelings). But I would want to at least know why it didn't work out!Related question: will existing contractors be automatically given a DCC? Or will there be some process for determining which existing contractors get DCCs?My only concern is that this system becomes corrupted in ways other commenters have worried about. If this turned into office politics as usual, I'm out. However, I generally trust the project leads' deep understanding (theoretical and experiential) of governance, system design, and automation. And I think the Decred's general strategy of incremental rollout is wise and tested. E.g. I'm glad a human is still distributing funds from Pi for now. If this works, it could unleash huge productivity gains and make Decred an even more exciting experiment. I want to work in a DAE.","3a20d101a08abad2e8382ce14b583b63879f6bf6879d01bb54181f579c147fad80564290907284112bc6499a0f5a54653a440c7614995fd5412f5facbc592e07","5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","37","05eaafd117416f563336c48a604b292d1ce31a2933f308ae1b13f1575a2e7e59076d321d4237a518b2c8da19f0326b1f9ccdd33757b391dff73c390029fe2107",1540934971,0,0,FALSE,NA,"DCC",4,6
