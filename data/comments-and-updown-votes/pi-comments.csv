Therefore, I support its continuation.

For a particular example of the quality of the current individuals running the program, one of the most challenging aspects of these bug bounty programs is typically the large number of invalid or trivial submissions that waste valuable developer time.  This can be seen by the numbers shared in the proposal which show that 84.5% of all submission have been invalid.  Nevertheless, the  way the program has handled the vetting process to screen out these time wasting submissions has been exemplary to date.

In regards to the final note, I think it's important to maintain a time frame in addition to a budget.  While there will always be a need for a bug bounty program, and when looking at it in that light, it might make sense to consider not attaching a time frame to it, these proposals apply to more than just the idea of program itself.

* The program requires qualified people to run it, and there is no guarantee that there are willing participants on an indefinite scale
* I would not be in support of the program if it were to become poorly managed due to personnel turnover
* I am generally not in favor of any type of proposals which involve indefinite payouts as it does not properly align the incentives and makes it much harder to keep things running smoothly over time when it becomes overly difficult to course correct when unforeseen circumstances occur","9aa4541720701f1518f1ea0c213771cc9529dce31dc1838883ec6e3b0063e3a17e62b05f89998bffa228f3f0ae599c3667e2b998c838e8926ebb25c4f0991302","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","4","c0277ab366549e14600b7447c6cb7ae7b3aac8842d67e242f9848d620053551c0f30e32d58712788a67f955da2c609cf607bcc5e646d6241af080e0829143a04",1560986682,0,0,FALSE,NA,"073694ed82d34b2bfff51e35220e8052ad4060899b23bc25791a9383375cae70/comments/4","davecgh",NA,15,15,8,NA

Does this mean _every_ future dataset that generates a commitment will _necessarily_ be a part of consensus or do you see this being used for non-consensus enforced (i.e. off-chain) inclusion proofs as well?

The GCS filters meant for light clients obviously need to be checked and _should_ be a part of consensus but I'm wondering if you think we'll also ones which (from the PoV of consensus) are only opaque commitments.

Random showerthought to exemplify what I mean by this: instead of using OP_RETURNs for dcrtime anchors, include a commitment for dcrtime's merkle root for a given period without having full nodes necessarily validate what the underlying dcrtime data is.

The individual commitments that are not checked via consensus rules have weaker security guarantees then the ones that are (and depend on mechanisms other than regular Decred full nodes to be useful) but I'm wondering whether you believe they should never even be considered or if you see this being useful in the future.","d6ed0264beb244262f803cde0c5d773ed828cb5ec4fe341c956d573a90fb69c49a3917b5b1c7af94083a93231b271108bfd4abf921060649937bc4cb1e399006","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","1","b148b92b4c098706b24682bb8fef40c1e140b3812ad443aea80f791576116e14c0927e8dd882992d0ca8bf4051fbadeba5ce90a2c0b61c62992831b9f781d40a",1559303741,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58/comments/1","matheusd",NA,13,13,8,NA

It is refreshing to be adding infrastructure like header commitments because it is something that has been discussed extensively in the Bitcoin community for years, but supporting this in Bitcoin would require a hard fork consensus change, which Bitcoin Core / Blockstream do not subscribe to.  IIRC, there has been discussion of including such a commitment in the coinbase for Bitcoin, which is a soft fork change.

Not every dataset will need a commitment in the header, but those that do will necessarily become part of consensus, yes.  In order to illustrate why, consider the structure of the commitment tree and the generation process.

```
     CommitmentRoot   
      /          \
  h(c1||c2)  h(c3||c4)
    /    \     /    \
   c1    c2   c3     c4
```

Let's assume that `c1` is the GCS filter commitment, `c2` is your hypothesized dcrtime merkle root, and `c3`/`c4` are commitments to other data.

Naturally in order to generate (and later validate) the `CommitmentRoot` you need to know that values of each of those leaf nodes (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`).

`c1` would be generated by creating the filter and hashing it.  Then, that hash needs to itself be hashed with `c2` to generate the `h(c1||c2)` intermediate node and the process repeats until the root is generated.  This necessarily means that `c2` has to be known, come from somewhere, and is now committed to by consensus via the `CommitmentRoot`.  Thus, even if nodes aren't verifying the validity of `c2` itself, it is still necessarily a part of consensus.

The bigger problem though is that if `c2` can't be generated from the block data itself, that implies it must be coming from some external entity, which introduces several issues for consensus because it would no longer be self contained nor decentralized.  In other words, it would introduce reliance on one or more 3rd-party oracles which moves into the realm  of the oracle problem.

For completeness, while I know it was just an example, it's worth noting that the dcrtime Merkle roots are already completely provable because they are included in an OP_RETURN in a transaction which itself is included in a Merkle tree whose root is committed to and enforced by the `MerkleRoot`header field which every full node faithfully validates.  Moving to a non-consensus enforced proof there would actually remove the security guarantees the current system provides and therefore largely remove its utility.

Any non-consensus enforced commitments can simply be delivered by a peer-to-peer message.","95976e613135bb178d247acbe22123fbdb2a292770db875a62c5d5087e8903ed761cafac268fb4bbe0990e9b5e76abc43d3fde463c62b17a2aedfebace13f402","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","4","210070973a0c90a3031b0d81fcb8873fb0a000be9a2488c371ab331b9a7e68e67da87b414657c29e928034082b53566393499ff4efca0c21bade1c7757d74201",1559344300,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0a1ff846ec271184ea4e3a921a3ccd8d478f69948b984445ee1852f272d54c58/comments/4","davecgh",NA,12,12,8,NA

I agree that header commitments are quite exciting in general.

Couple of things I found interesting about the bitcoin implementation.

1. There are no on-chain commitments of these filters yet, it appears the plan is to add to the filter commitment as a soft fork by tacking it into the coinbase transaction as an additional OP_RETURN.
2. OP_RETURN transactions are not part of the commitments at all, due to a circular dependency issue (the filter commitment OP_RETURN value obviously cannot reference itself in its construction). This limits some potential use cases. 

It will be really interesting to see if/how an effort soft fork Bitcoin to append the filter commitments to the coinbase transaction plays out. It may be contentious since the additional data does take up valuable block space. 

I love how Decred's ability to execute a clean hard fork makes it possible to implement the same end goal as BIP 158 in a simpler, more efficient and more useful general purpose way. It's telling how modifying the headers is not even mentioned as a possibility in any of the BIP 157/158 discussions!

As for OP_RETURN... it looks like Decred's commitments will include the entire transaction set and would therefore open up potential use cases for light clients to utilize OP_RETURN, such as those created by dcrtime, securely.

Since you brought up BIP 158, it's worth noting that dcrd includes an earlier version of GCS filters than those defined in the BIP (they were included in release v1.2.0 that was released in May 2018).  The part of this proposal that refers to introducing version 2 of the filters includes additional optimizations that have been devised since then, including those in the aforementioned BIP.

While you did hint at it by discussing the fact that putting the additional data in the coinbase would take up valuable block space and mentioning that the Decred approach outlined in this proposal is more efficient and more general purpose, I thought it might be good to make that point more explicit by calling out that the approach taken by this proposal does not take up any additional block space at all since the data gets rolled up into a single Merkle root that takes the place of the current `StakeRoot` field in the header and the existing `StakeRoot` field is folded into the `MerkleRoot` field.  This is an important consideration since increasing the amount of data that must be stored on chain is always something that must be done with great care.

In regards to `OP_RETURN` data, you're correct on all accounts.

All of that said, and aside from the fact this is not even close to being a proper proposal, the concept of ProgPoW for Decred gets a hard pass from me.","04fd8bb4fc10cfcc496c5068495bffef7bec5e1b38b06fd80ab3ad29b1c0ce009fb42425c04f1ba46b34e08b301b5190b9505cd64a7bd4807da306a43cf97c0d","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","1","319cd54f6c164120a80be2b166605ca2894e1c32b34c94bb20d3d595ff7de853272c3267f69bd50414b6b3e222d0f6b8c4a8e2454b94d70d970b9ae6aa40e50c",1542045474,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/1","davecgh",NA,24,24,8,NA

On the content,  I believe this is an horrible idea.... GPUs are more vulnerable to large ""Chinese"" mining farms because there is far less risk to build a GPU farm than using ASICs.  With a GPU farm you can change the coin you mine as often as you want, and even resell the hardware for it's real purpose (gaming). You don't really have skin in the game.

With an ASICs farm,  you can only mine one coin, you cannot resell easily, the risk is higher to get stuck with that hardware. You are quite a bit more invested in the currency you mine.

Maybe the only moment that argument would hold IMO is when a coin is already exclusively mined on GPUs and a new ASIC could be made in secret and take over.  However  in an well established coin like Decred where we have multiple ASICs manufacturers and a strong governance system which can keep miners in check I see this suggestion as an immense step back in security.","42014516845f978fef58ff9e1b3963006fb2e3d8191803cf865087af251c3cbd1171528ebf19a759389f9444b0eaceec1d1811e6621b92dcd5568d685b5f200f","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","2","b63c6ac83c325b6cfcc47ec43d1b9d9a27bfebf9156f193dc76eed4b598cdd552a3ab537819fbdf52869d7cc439397e088636dfd35ccd98a391e138c5cbfb603",1542045691,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/2","nnnko56",NA,18,18,8,NA

Because of the hybrid PoW/PoS system, it's roughly 20X more expensive to 51% attack, according to recent analysis. This means ASICs pose less risk. In fact, there is a strong argument they increase security, as the increased hashrate they provide, paired with PoS voting, increases the total cost to 51% attack. There could be a possible danger if there was only one or two ASIC manufacturers mining in secret, centralizing nearly all the hashpower. However, the Decred team, perhaps seeing this danger, signaled that they were ASIC friendly from the start, resulting in like half a dozen (or more) ASICs from different manufacturers coming to market, leading to decentralization within the ASIC mining community. 

Also, while I appreciate that this important issue is raised, it seems clear to me from Decred comm channels (slack, telegram, reddit, medium, etc.) that the vast majority of the community is ASIC friendly. I don't think we should waste the stakeholders' time with proposals we know won't pass.","365274b934b53ff2fd9f30679200f2ade36636d6134dc899e9ffad981c001e21583bd212db410405d36ca45dbc0da282a191faa6344cc75fa16c431ca4c3b509","5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","6","6e8fd8f25dd156d61f25db0d6162817eee3caeaac804926daa82458b4819909027e1963ea00655a6f0616b6203d70ed005300a1bff4e5bbb4322626384cd5308",1542454348,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/6","s_ben",NA,10,10,8,NA

Another way to drive new community adoption is through PoS ""mining"" (now called PoS voting) via ticket splitting. Right now, tickets cost around $5k, which is out of reach for many potential new community members, just as ASICs are. But with ticket splitting coming online, that comes down to around a couple hundred dollars. This could in effect make Decred the lowest barrier to entry ""masternode"" (though that term is not exactly accurate, it's close enough). Masternodes are a big thing now, especially as the bear market wears on, and people are searching for more steady returns.

First of all I would like to thank you for your opinions on our proposal, since listening to the community and taking advantage of their experience is the best way to reach an approach that maximizes the benefit that the Decred project can get from the proposals that are launched. Allow me then to respond to your suggestions in the best possible way to clarify the points that we have not explained well enough and rectify those where necessary.

I would like to make clear that this is not an all or nothing, this is a proposal to the community, to make use of our environment beyond the publication of news from the sector. If part of the proposal or its totality does not conform to the needs of Decred we have no problem in retiring or rethinking it.

We are aware that Decred is already being covered by other media, as the second phase of the Ditto Communications proposal was recently approved, we simply have not seen the need to extend our proposal with information that the community already knows and that does not concern the work we are proposing to carry out.

What we are proposing is an addition to increase media coverage. Given that in the world there are almost 8 billion people, of which less than 100 million use blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, we believe that all broadcasting work is good to promote the change, and of the thousands of existing projects, we believe that Decred It is one of the few that should be made known to the greatest number of people today.

We are sorry that the approach of the Crypto of the Month contest seems like a bad idea, but let me explain it a little more in detail so that the idea is better understood. The Crypto of the Month emerged as an idea at the beginning of this year as a disinterested initiative that would allow us to promote the few projects that in our humble opinion seem serious to us and with a value for society, beyond producing a promising product with which to enrich oneself quickly. The Crypto of the Month itself is not a contest but a series of actions that we carry out during that month to make the project known to our readers. The contest itself is a way to encourage readers to share the contest (as they get more tickets) and help more people receive the message.

Sadly we are aware that today the proportion of people interested in cryptocurrencies for noble reasons is very low, compared to those who have seen in this new market the opportunity to make easy money, but we are also aware that the latter can serve as messengers so that the message of Decred reaches those few who are interested in the change of economic paradigm that we are sure this technology is making possible. As you can see, until now the projects that have been Crypto of the Month are Grin (MW), Waves, Komodo and Decentraland. As for the actions to be carried out in the contest, these are aimed at spreading the word about them and making known both the promoted project and our media itself, given that until now all the contests of the Crypto of the Month have been disinterested and funded by ourselves.

For this contest, given that unlike the previous ones, Crypto Economy is not assuming the cost of it, we had thought that the actions to be carried out by the participants to obtain those tickets were such as:

Visit blog Decred
Follow twitter decred
Share the contest (twitter, whatsapp ..)

Let me clarify that we do not need $100 a month to carry out the contest, the total cost of the contest is $1,200 and it will be done during a single month. The cost is that because the prize we would like to give away is $1,000. The other $200 is the administration costs, social network advertising, and the fee that Gleam.io charges us. I have put a cost of $100 per month simply by dividing it by 12 months given that in the table of costs that we have added to the proposal we break down the monthly and annual costs.

Regarding the proposal of videos on youtube. After talking with the youtubers with whom we have dealings, we have come to the conclusion that the exclusive videos about a specific project do not have as much impact as the inclusion of brief spaces that talk about the project in videos of general interest, such as in a weekly news video about cryptocurrencies, the youtuber can talk for a short time about Decred, ensuring that its viewers receive the message. These youtubers are going to dedicate a time and resources to the elaboration of their videos and that is the reason why they charge us for their services. Since this is not a service that we are going to lend directly, but we will use our contacts to act as intermediaries of this with non-profit, we will be transparent in its management. However, like everything in this proposal, it is likely to be modified or removed if the community considers it appropriate.

On the last point, the one that talks about the accepted currencies, you are right, it is our custom to give facilities but in this case it is unnecessary, I am going to modify the proposal to correct this part.

I hope more members of the community will comment on their opinions as well so that we can adjust the proposal to the needs of the project and the community of Decred.

Again, thanks for your comments.","d1ebeecb239969e4623e1090137a5280b520ef115c2831f21966a26b8d6a4a6485a9a62a09b107d27223a229335c3ce53035efcd60030d1fae4432207f991602","6bf827030057fcc9fc6c8d4719dad36cd985014f9ebbf06aca10c0b152b5b406","3","c8fc6bc0f5f453c20438d18bfc0f1fd5ab418e64bf7f93a124620addfa6e4a5ee12d2bb68a7660b97066fbd5c3c4b8d81019524d855696466678399b0972be03",1560349728,0,0,FALSE,NA,"1a367dcb91b55c60ad5fd038b219201154fcab965edd7a4639f157e409b1f4bf/comments/3","cryptoeconomy",0,0,0,0,0

The following is a short recap of some of the concerns I have with the proposal:

* The proposal fails to recognize that many of the suggested services already have ongoing efforts without identifying the overlap or adequately explaining the distinguishing characteristics.  This indicates to me that it is likely because the proposal author(s) is/are not actively engaged with the community and therefore is/are unaware of them.
* It appears that the proposal author(s) did not take the time to become familiar with with how payments are conducted.  I'm aware the proposal has since been edited accordingly, based on other comments, but this is very basic research that I believe should have been done prior to submitting a proposal.
* Some activities that are fairly widely known to generally not be supported by the community have been proposed without also identifying and making a case why stakeholders should change their mind.  Again, this suggests to me that the proposal author(s) seem to be out of sync with the community.
* There are multiple instances of incorrectly spelling the name.  I understand typos happen, however, in a proposal that is requesting funds in areas that specifically deal with interacting with the public, getting the name wrong, more than once, does not instill a lot of confidence.","d7bfeceecfe4b9727d56304e0e3536b7f3865c12818503f03655990a8bb68eb79aeaa02a75005e12a86284363b310a97206f107494a927db65d9975bb9b94307","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","6","5bf850294cc44cd7430f654de5d64bca14bcee6ff72f90b338915e2043ecf5bc4320e63eade60875bc51c10fc1b219dbd5a380b9bf133a028254ea16f24e3802",1560400108,0,0,FALSE,NA,"1a367dcb91b55c60ad5fd038b219201154fcab965edd7a4639f157e409b1f4bf/comments/6","davecgh",NA,9,9,8,NA

One only needs to look at the excellent work coming out of Coinmetrics, Adaptive Capital and Woobull.com for Bitcoin to see the value of a solid set on on-chain analysis tools. In particular, live analysis of Tickets will be a big focus of mine and I will be seeking to utilise this tool.

“Specialization of resources, standards for interchangeable parts, and streamlined assembly tools have been used in other industries for hundreds of years to speed the development of highly complex products. Despite their ubiquity, application of these concepts to the modern software industry is just beginning. Visual Basic 5.0 advances this trend considerably by finally making it easy for millions of developers to create and assemble high-performance, broadly reusable ActiveX components.”

**Ideas**

I suggest to make it as discoverable as possible:

- Add labels to GitHub repository (Decred, cryptocurrency, blockchain)
- Publish it in popular package repositories (PyPI, others?)
- Announce the package in relevant dev blogs (Hacker Noon, others?)
- Submit it to relevant discussion platforms (find blockchain/python/dev subreddits, HackerNews, etc)
- Write tutorial dev articles (e.g. ""Watching Decred Treasury in Python"", ""Watching Decred airdrop addresses in Python"")
- Host workshops with building on Decred in Python
- If it becomes popular, package for popular distros (Arch, Debian, etc)

**Questions**

This proposal asks to compensate past work but I'm not seeing the budget for future development - what is the funding plan?

> As a Decred project, TinyDecred will enjoy all the benefits and suffer all the scrutiny associated with official Decred projects.

Since this involves other people, I'd like to hear from decred organization maintainers - would they accept and maintain this repo? Are there any Python seniors to look after it?

Are people available for initial code review?

How many dependencies does it have? Are they well maintained? Do they have large codebases? Did anybody audit them?

Do you plan organizing an internal or external audit of the critical parts of the code (e.g. crypto, handling hostile data, etc)?

> This proposal asks to compensate past work but I'm not seeing the budget for future development - what is the funding plan?

Good question. Because Decred is pioneering a new type of decentralized workplace, the rules are sometimes being written as we go. 
When I first asked about getting this work brought in, it was even mentioned that this would be a test case for this Shark-Tank style of contribution.

I'd like to hear from others on this topic, but here is my best understanding. 
Once brought under the Decred umbrella, hours for development and maintenance would not be pre-approved via proposal.
Instead, development expenditures are tacitly 
[approved by the stakeholders through the contractor system](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f).
I would also make it a point to request approval via proposal for any work that varies significantly from the path described here.
Stakeholders would, of course, hold the power to halt development on the project or even reverse this proposal if they don't like the direction it's going. 

> Are people available for initial code review?

I'm hoping to get a solid endorsement for you, but nobody has deep dived yet. I'll try to get you something soon.
I certainly invite everyone to have a look at things and run some tests. 
Unit tests are implemented via Python's built-in [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) framework.
I'm not saying everything's perfect. There are a couple of design choices that even I question, but they are relatively low-impact and easy to path correct. Part of the reason I'd like to get this work brought in is because I'll have a larger pool of expertise to draw from.

> How many dependencies does it have? Are they well maintained? Do they have large codebases? Did anybody audit them?

All dependencies can be installed through PyPI with

    pip install PyQt5 websocket_client blake256 base58 pynacl appdirs

So just 6 dependencies, and I would consider them all well-maintained. `PyQt5` is the only one that I'd consider irreplaceable, and it's only needed if using the GUI wallet (more comments below).
I agree that dependency auditing is super important, so I would definitely be doing that before any releases.

> Do you plan organizing an internal or external audit of the critical parts of the code (e.g. crypto, handling hostile data, etc)?

Internal auditing via code reviews and good unit testing always. External auditing would need to be stakeholder-approved, I think, but definitely open to it. There has been some broader discussion of external auditing elsewhere. I think things are still evolving on that front. 

> Will it be packaged in such a way that a sole library dependency can be installed without pulling in the GUI? Would it be better to have separate repositories for the library and the user-facing wallet?

I think it makes a lot of sense for this to be released as two separate PyPI packages. 
I'd like to keep things in one parent repo, but I'm not married to it. 
My reasoning is that these two major parts are going to develop in lock-step for the forseeable future. 
Want for a new feature on the GUI wallet will drive implementation of lower-level features. 
Often it will be desirable to make changes to both as a single pull request.","f6bbeca1c7b6e79a4baa3ce4b526e3d1f33ae0963e8f7079107c08bdd2d76fc863f0aab8e61f1bb5ae18c09f79c58aeab9d32d14bcb625ddfd3637a3f2dd570c","7e0d27a299b37423a7951e30361c178fdd6cbdc731b62a6c33c1185aabd5e60a","15","eed496df54f42f3bb118e7ef88cbc9cdc67105c8b7ae41b1aaf643f591534d0ecc1c799b98294638d133625e2c53e18bed3a6b95c29fda0f21812a7b6b588f0d",1564933575,0,0,FALSE,NA,"20e967dad9e7398901decf3cfe0acf4e0853f6558a62607265c63fe791b8b124/comments/15",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

- Automation of simple wallet functionality (creating wallets, checking balances, transferring DCR, etc.). This could be useful in a number of contexts, including portfolio management, security (e.g. simulating attacks), privacy, etc.

1. It displays a lack of confidence in the project on the part of the firm making the proposal.
2. It requires the use of an intermediary to accept DCR and then convert it to USD so payment can be made.
3. It negates our ability to create an ecosystem in which Decred is used as a currency, and in the ideal scenario, our contractors potentially become stakeholders.

2. An apparent no prior interest in Decred and disbursement of 2/3rds of monthly funds for the campaign in fiat does highlight a lack of belief in the success of the project; the 1/3rd payable in DCR being a ""safe"" investment for when/if it makes it big.

We did help rewrite the Politea press release, which resulted from several productive conversations with multiple Decred members over the past few weeks. You can see the final result [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million).

Importantly, Ditto was founded on “introductory retainers,” which means proving ourselves and growing. From what we understand, though, there’s a lot of work to be done. We are firm believers in only proposing what a client truly needs (and what we know we can succeed at). And sometimes that means doing one thing really well and growing from there.

Six months is a pretty standard length for a PR campaign — it’s what you’ll encounter with just about any firm you work with. We do offer a 90 day termination clause, meaning if we don’t do what we said we would do in the first 90 days, you have every right to fire us. Honestly, no one has ever utilized that clause.

One more point about our prior experience. We have worked with many serious projects with a long-term roadmap — everyone from Monero to Augur to Chronicled to Origin to Kadena to CoinList – the list goes on. We are a PR firm that has proven itself in the past two years as a team that knows blockchain.

Also, we pride ourselves on being capable of handling as much of the work as possible. Other PR firms definitely aren’t like that. We will request a thorough onboarding and be true partners moving forward, meaning we will be doing most of the work.

Honestly, I was quite impressed with your proposal until I got down to the ""When"" part. Paying out in fiat is a huge deal-breaker for me.

I understand there is a risk involved when accepting crypto payment, especially when dealing with a 6-month contract. If DCR suffers a catastrophic event that puts the price into a significant downturn, you're stuck with a contract to fulfill, accepting money that's loosing value every day. As has been mentioned in some of the other comments here, there is also concerns about the 90-day out clause.

May I suggest modifying this proposal to have monthly payouts of DCR, with the option for either party (the Decred stakeholders or Ditto) to terminate the relationship at the close of any given month (perhaps with a requirement of 15 or 30-day notice)? 
- This gives you the leeway to terminate the contract if you're no longer comfortable accepting DCR for payment.
- This also gives the stakeholders an option to opt-out if expected results are not delivered. Stakeholder opt-out would be made in the form of a new Politeia proposal terminating the relationship.","3d6f7585b6085f26dc09e8c198c866d5a72038f4c2ce3d41cf42187c55e714b05ac8fea25c3771d579f6d47882ea6de0a9ac7fcff465304a1757afaf1028f50f","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","b4fba50e7b8d0f0b1d49250eca3ddad3c4e71af6b01aa159c7696ebd92921320b342ed672f584d7ae2958e56177c83998f7a41829abfb2e37d5fcf19abcc0007",1540250595,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/12","ryanzim",NA,13,13,8,NA

I see two competing proposals for PR services, and I believe that both firms would bring better visibility to Decred. I have however one major concern after reading comments here and on slack so I will be posting this exact message/question to both contenders:

The Decred devs and team members are doing an enormous job at the moment with all the work being done; balancing their precious time between coding, testing, speaking about Decred, writing material, answering questions, attending events and being active on various platforms.

How would your firm specifically help or provide assistance, so that the team can remain efficient in those tasks while increasing visibility?

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.

I do have a similar concern as posted to Wachsmans brief around the _“positioning, messaging, and talking points""_ and having all directional roles rather without any dedicated copywriter/creative/strategist roles. So I will repeat the same train of thought from Wachsmans commentary: 

> “Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation
This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)
Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly.
Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.
When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.
Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.
This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.
Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to.”

From what i’ve seen at dittopr.co, the case studies are very oriented towards the statistical/reach and journalism outputs. I would be rather interested in seeing work that demonstrates more tangible outputs of creative problem solving, thought and strategic ability, and even sheer writing ability, and this being in a brands context rather than only journalism. Ideally this should relate to the expected outputs planned for Decred and have the work talk for itself. 

Considering the Wachsmans competitive proposal is up also, what would you consider your main edge on them? 

Thanks.","4327c6d713b7de22835411e927f21342ad28157be2f6290fbce4623aaac13eb19ff9779ba192a0d2b77a374398f262d62aa7fb161d77367ee5575439f52b0304","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","22","fbe144c37bdd54410c0959bc93468b8d0b74aa3039327ab65f472d017dbfc456427da2afc62a9e743d066c91c6acb975f88cf80b73599e423250f05e1133aa02",1540330293,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/22",NA,NA,14,12,10,NA

We have a lot to cover from this comment. First, let me say you are asking all the right questions. We are enjoying answering all of them!

“Positioning, messaging and talking points” is probably one of the most important things Ditto does for its blockchain clients. I’d add “media training,” as well.

What you say and how you say it is critical to achieve what we are trying to accomplish. And from Ledger to Origin to Monero to Kadena, we spent a lot of time early on working on this. For some clients, it was more about what they say to different audiences. For other clients, it was about simply coming up with one document on “how to explain ourselves.” We’ve been doing that a lot recently. In a decentralized company, we’d like for everyone to be able to explain who they work for as similarly as possible. That is important not only for journalists, but for internal purposes, as well.

A lot of the founders we work with – many, if not most, are devs – have never done an interview before. So we need to make sure that 1) they know what to say and 2) they are comfortable conducting an interview. That’s why media training is important. We want to make sure that when you talk to anyone from CoinDesk to The New York Times (which you will), you crush it.

I hope that answers one part of your question.

Moving on…

Trey, who founded Ditto, was originally a reporter at the Associated Press. Writing will always be important at Ditto. In fact, we recently hired a VP Kris Kitto, who was also a reporter in Washington D.C. Kris oversees content at Ditto and regularly teaches the rest of us how to be a better writer. Everyone at Ditto is expected to be a good writer. That’s also because we are generalists, meaning we pride ourselves on being good at all the core tenets of PR. Ditto isn’t for everyone. There are PR people out there who JUST want to manage clients or JUST do media relations. A lot of us have some kind of specialty, but we are pretty freakin’ good at all the core communications offerings.

Also, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed. I don’t want to talk too much about Wachsman, who I respect and talk to regularly, but Ditto is outspoken about what makes us different and better, and I think this is an important differentiator to point out. Our team is senior-level PR people. We don’t staff our accounts with one person who’s just good at events, and one senior person who would probably just “manage.” That’s just not how we operate… and it’s working!

A bit of “how the sausage is made:” Every account is required to come up with one smart idea every month. What does that mean? It means strategic advice is mandatory at Ditto. It means that we are thinkers and doers.

I wish we had time to update some of our case studies, but we’ve been busy on client work. That’s another difference between Ditto and our competitors. We are a bunch of super smart PR folks who do a ton of crypto and blockchain work. Every client is important, and every week we bust our ass to give them good counsel and get them the awareness they deserve. Big PR firms have sales people and marketing people who can create case studies on messaging to make them sound good. We just haven’t had the time to do that yet.","e4fc46d30ed2805f070aa14d9f851ee1d04a3c01118a453e09db9f00af97f554d544adfd759151d1e7b4d6f1c8b00187b7b8f7855058f14a4c85cc916251220d","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","23","342362d87853e0a9e128f535d51b701e45c9a89c6361badaa97ae001bcdaec190082885b892526e4e52c9ee78a56919fd776d123c08a882fffdcdc1a2e065008",1540342057,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/23",NA,NA,12,11,9,NA

Why not, simply lay out a separate contract between you and that party to process the DCR <=> USD exhange according to the terms agreed and remove the USD requirement from this proposal?

Otherwise, the problem I see is that the Decred entity itself has no central authority and cannot for example, open a bank account and process USD payments.

The various stakeholders like myself, who together form this decentralized entity, only have the ability to allow DCR payments from the treasury by voting on proposals. So you may find difficult to have them agree to enter a contract in which they are required to do something impossible (make payments in USD).

Furthermore, as the goal is to eventually have payments made automatically using a smart contract based on votes, this kind of DCR/USD arrangements in a proposal will eventually not be possible anymore unless an intermediary makes the proposal in DCR, and then contract the services is USD.

Finally one danger of leaving the proposal ""as is"", is that it leaves the impression for future proposal, that the treasury can be disbursed to contractors in USD (which is technically false and can only be achieved with a third party).","53a224b2da5ff904946ddde17b96df527d4abd71107139e4629b7601b7caa97348e85b7b60488352478e2f34a0ddfe8e346c61a47e9b0f5b591bb921021d5307","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","24","6d103862d992de73de4b9cabb67c5241dd72661910c363b92ae5596d829a4049b1a8fdcc1c61e2945ab243880d80c0a7744cdaea300d8f702e0369830f7fd101",1540342294,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/24","nnnko56",NA,9,9,8,NA

I feel some important details are still left out of the proposal. Before I can make up my mind on how to vote I have a few questions and remarks, some more fundamental to Decred in general than others.

First off, how do you envision your impact on Decred after the contract is over? And to be more precise on this point, what are you deliverables? How, as stakeholders, do we test your performance? Where and in what manner will you report? How do we hold you accountable? This is important to know, because how otherwise do we make use of the opt-out clause.

Who is paying the Decred representatives you media train? Who selects these representatives? Will they be paid from this budget? Will event registration fees and other associated costs (like hotel, etc) that you arrange be paid from this budget?

And as a more fundamental question tied to this, who are the people that are representing Decred? We have yet to see a proposal in the spirit of 'I want to represent Decred at events,' or 'this company/group of people wants to take care of event representation and presence.'
Are you proposing to train Company 0 employees or freelancers or your own employees?

Then as others have asked in both this proposal and the other marketing one, (why) do you think Decred needs your entire proposed suite of services for a relatively short 6-month period?","13d62bbfcd360e236e33f157c27f6cb449b160af56b1c0873205e41288bc4b6b6295b3ec2fbc9ece70315322f240fbce1632d5aa6661aaeecb5125166e66140f","00c09bb145ae4ddf1d5ec5a6a80e2697d081e8cf906600c3fca7a9f0e2dca0ab","31","53861a2da20cc0daa8f60c1d9dbd597f6e15d69ba7e89940405b9363c21f90274889cc862f49c2501ddd51232251eea244e5614eb13c524dfa7566c9a4adad09",1540469720,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/31",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

It starts by aligning on KPIs and objectives, which will be determined as part of the onboarding process. We’ve already talked about some of the objectives that the community believes are important, but we’ll want to get specific. For instance: How many pieces of coverage per month, how many pieces of content we will produce, how many events per quarter, etc.  That said, we only propose what we think a client needs.

Things we think about:
1) Expert sourcing – When reporters write about governance issues they should be quoting someone from Decred
2) Proactive pitching – Identify monthly issues/topics relevant to Decred that will generate media coverage
3) Quality vs. quantity – We want to balance top tier crypto (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, etc.) with top tier mainstream (NYT, WSJ, Laura Shin, Bloomberg)
4) Decred features – What story lines provide us opportunities to get those bigger stories? We should always be thinking big.
5) News announcements – Do we want to get one really good story through an exclusive, or do we reach out to a handful of reporters?

Once we align in understanding where there is opportunity, we can then layout expected outputs. Ballpark, we tend to get 5-10 pieces of coverage each month for our crypto clients. Where there’s news, it’s even higher.

Onboarding takes no more than 30 days, ideally. This is some of the most important foundation work we will do. This includes messaging, identifying topics/issues Decred should be talking about, looking at any upcoming announcements, news opportunities, etc. We are a results-focused PR firm, so we love outputs and deliverables.

We tend to have a weekly check-in with our clients. Most of that is accountability: What have we done this week, what are we doing next week. Also, there’s some accountability on the client side: We need X and Y from you (without creating too much extra work on your end). Again, this is a partnership.

What we are most eager to get to is the harder results: media coverage, securing speaking engagements, publishing op-eds, etc. One of the things our team couldn’t stand while working at bigger, global PR firms was 30, 60, 90 days into a new client, the firm was still “strategizing” and “creating memos,” but the client was like “Yeah, but where are the results??” There’s a lot of important foundational work to be done, but Ditto is always eager to “go external.”

I would check with Dustin from Decred on additional fees. Things like travel and conference fees are not traditionally included in PR plans. Also, on who is representing Decred. That would be part of what we’d hope to discover during the onboarding process. The same is true for media training. Once we identify who or whom will be representing Decred from an external standpoint, we will train them on certain aspects of how to engage with the media that will hopefully ensure leads to coverage with the right message being conveyed. All media training is included in the price of the monthly agreement.","9a1bb3540602f91bc0668c686abf1a0ef53095b869f8b2f64d417551132bedcaaab2500ec74143fe3ad85dfbd0cde3b8407cced4f7aa9d55964171d89e1a0704","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","32","bd39c1c6de7bbebb08615a34e9a09c5adca7f397b3ec85c92684863869ce0d1585de8805a308ee46b4c34a330c5f935edefaf7f30b7d8489cf24889e0a868c01",1540487434,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/32",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

**First, what are the main differences between Wachsman and Ditto?**

This is a really good and important question. As we alluded to in our proposal on Politeia, Ditto is very much an “anti-PR firm” in that we fundamentally believe the traditional business model of PR firms is broken.

Firstly, everyone at Ditto has a technical level of expertise and understands the nuances of blockchain/crypto in a way that far surpasses our competitors.

Secondly, we understand your culture and your community, and we share your values. We’ve worked with decentralized communities like Monero that place a premium on privacy and unanimity. We’ve listened to the feedback the community has given, and we’ve made the necessary adjustments. We understand and appreciate the unique characteristics that make the Decred community what it is, which will translate into the right kind of advice and partnership when it comes time to do the work, versus more traditional marketing tactics or buzzwords.

The third and most important differentiator is results. We believe in radical honestly and transparency and will only tell you what we believe to be possible. What you see is what you get, and we’re happy to provide a synopsis of the results we’ve gotten over the years. Our vast network of reporters and the relationships we have in the media value this, as well. So when we pitch a story or reach out to a journalist, they know and appreciate the companies that work with Ditto are of the highest legitimacy and credibility.

Finally, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed (more on that in a bit).

**Next question: Can you justify the 5k extra that Ditto is asking for compared to Wachsman?**

As outlined in our conversations with the Decred community prior to this process, the fee matches the proposed scope of work. Content, media relations, conferences/events, thought leadership, and the amount of time and resources we would devote to this led us to $25K in DCR. If it is determined that the community only wants content and media relations, as opposed to conferences and events, we can adjust the proposal and the price accordingly. I also want to point out that both our CEO Trey Ditto and myself — the two most senior people at Ditto — will staff the account and give you personalized attention.

**Next question: I see you have a Monero as one of your clients. Someone asked Ricardo his involvement with ditto and he mentioned that he worked with your company on a personal level not with Monero. Could you please elaborate.**

We worked with Monero around their Project Coral Reef announcement, and we were subsequently hired by Tari, a project by Ric and Naveen. That, to us, indicates that they were pleased with the level of service we provided and hired us for a launch announcement that was widely covered. It’s worth noting, like with a lot of clients, we do know Ric on a personal level, as well. We are partners with our clients. By the way, here’s [an article]( http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/crypto-blockchain-monero-ticketfly-project-tari/) we generated in Fortune for the Tari announcement and here’s [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#1955c93060eb) we generated in Forbes for Monero. There we of course multiple other outlets that covered this news.  

**And finally: Would you be able to provide a list of Ditto team members who we can expect to interact with on a daily basis?**

The Ditto team members who would interact with you on a regular basis are the ones listed in our proposal: our CEO Trey Ditto, Managing Director Blain Rethmeier, Vice President Margaret Huang, Account Executive Milvian Prieto, and Associate Vice President Liz Bagot.","1e00a6419d34f50b3471688092ebc0c3b95482f18387ec51a14000be7579e21c9b8c3563d38041f859475bfa95f931ef9ff7e151d335dabfffa2dc347f7f6a02","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","33","b3f9a71a0b810e70ddbb3d4731bf9a6fef8382667394db6224286b116e2e7e785a1f37508748f0ea094eacd4123bc14c548dd21e3fa67d2e85f1d7efdb4cd50a",1540494071,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/33",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

But if we are being honest, one of the reasons Ditto and Wachsman are the top two crypto PR firms out there is because of our results. Top tier results are what we have in common! That’s good news for Decred.

So, [here’s a smattering of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPcDM7hjwgNDxlkQOmZ3ChW2EQzbtBl6wpHZZk4_1Mo/edit?usp=sharing) we’ve secured for some of crypto clients over the past year. 

We chose the past year as the timeframe because we want to show that we didn’t just have a lucky couple of weeks — this is month over month consistency and delivering on what we promised. And we chose a handful of clients and just a sampling of coverage because that should show you that media coverage is one of the things we are good at.

But even in the past week, clients have had features in everything from _CoinDesk_ to _SF Business Times_ to _Bloomberg TV_ to _Breaker Magazine_ to _The Block_. We could be here all day just going through “media hits”!

When I look at our list and Wachsman’s list, there are a few differences: Ditto has a much more robust mix of national TV, top tier crypto, and top tier mainstream. Don’t get me wrong — there are some Tier 2/3, but our coverage seems a little more elevated.

Also, the final thing I’d add, just looking at Wachsman’s coverage, is that they have a lot of stories written by contributors, whereas we tend to work directly with staff reporters. One, working directly with reporters means more people will read the story. Two — and we aren’t saying this is the case — but a lot of contributors are pay-to-play. That’s just not our style.

In the interest of moving beyond just getting clients hits, there’s a backstory to every time a client is in the news. What went into that?

1)    **Being proactive** – Ditto saw a trend in the industry and positioned the client

2)    **Important issues** – Clients have issues/topics (community, scaling, speed, security, etc.), and we keep them in the news on those issues

3)    **Messaging** – We put in the time to make sure we are relaying to the media the clients’ stories in a way that ensures positive coverage

4)    **Talking Points** – Before any interview, we think about, “What do we want to say in this specific interview to get our point across?”

5)    **Media training** – Could be as simple as a quick mock interview the day before, but we make sure the client is as ready as possible

So, while we can just look at volume and quality, at Ditto, there’s a lot more care that goes into what ends up being printed.","0421a68e06a351ba0c62a1d7d7f56480859b99f1da69577769664e0ce2e71eb76186368917c218f5ecfc531d1c023e636e97fac0ae3a4fd8363797d53501ed0a","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","34","63c686853241c4a50ce57307743fac459d1ca7eb3e806cace415d4472afec00972c02321731d2fd3c190c8188f1d0dca0c0362a72e12ee5c596d67251bcf030b",1540503319,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/34",NA,NA,11,10,9,NA

We will need to work with the community to determine which specific metrics Decred wants to impact so that we can measure them — and this is something we will want to determine at the very beginning of our relationship.

The plan we laid out focuses on community growth and engagement by raising your visibility, elevating your brand and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences.

Metrics aside, there is something to be said about overall “awareness.” Many of our clients who have never done PR before say “We just want the community to know about us more.” And a lot of that work is targeting devs and the crypto community. It’s hard to measure awareness, although we utilize a few platforms to gauge traction of stories. And we are constantly monitoring what is and isn’t working and making adjustments.

Regarding timing, we can’t think of a better time than now. Politeia is live, and we’re at the very beginning of a revolution. PR now will help drive awareness, facilitate development, and increase awareness of future Decred updates. It’s important to get started as early as possible — especially now that the product is live and working, and real proposals are being written and voted on.

How do you guys at Ditto measure success internally?

Can you provide some guidance on how Decred could come up with  success measures we can establish up front to set concrete expectations, and set targets you can measure yourselves against so that success is not solely subjective and ambiguous? 

Any examples of top client interactions that were the most successful and why would be helpful.","bbd44563e47a3813a6515bdc231d0d5c6b665e1e4c7e6f5926beaa72dd8c7f255922eb5f70629d66214dbad7a6f7e2f4a7510f6edbcacd74ec6f9b03b9aac606","6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","37","6cbbeb9d9bd66afac2de2183318418b5bc6bfe73a6d36a7e48da64d1b8c7bfbefbae7c5d90e555968bfa507527e7d8823c7b06cc5d09fe219705f8e000590d0d",1540656111,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/37","nottrunner",NA,10,10,8,NA

Every month client teams come together and set their metrics that align with each client. Every account is different, but it basically includes: quantity and quality of media coverage, content written and published and one what we call an “extended communication” (social media, speaking, award submission, partnership, etc.). 

As we have said in other comments, we believe in going much farther than outputs, which we are really good at. We also measure quality of service. Every account has to come together and send the client one “smart idea” each month. This pushes us to be creative, proactive and always trying something new. 

The best feedback we got once was from Avi Flombaum, co-founder of Flatiron School: Every month Ditto sent us a new idea, pushing us to stay ahead. We didn’t act on many of them, which was more an internal thing on our end, but it showed us that Ditto understood our business and was always thinking about us. 

Finally, we have a “client facing” section, meaning we should be talking to the client on a personal and professional level every month. Again, we are your partner! Our internal metrics – which Trey has to approve – are historically higher than what the client expects. Here’s the fun part: Every team that does all these things: hits their outputs, sends a creative idea and interacts with the client gets a bonus at the end of the month.

It’s why Ditto is a better PR firm. We believe in doing high quality, high output work and then rewarding staffers for doing killer work.

Examples of interactions. First, I’m happy to put you in touch with Avi from Flatiron School. They were a client for 4 years – until WeWork bought them. It’s the perfect example of Ditto:
1) Lifelong partners – As I said above, it was a deep partnership where we cared about them and vice versa. Trey and Avi became best friends in fact.
2) Month over month results – for 4 years, they averaged 100+ stories every year.
3) High quality – They were front page WSJ, Business Section B1 of NYT, on national TV 4+ times a year.
4) Results attached to business – When we got them coverage, website traffic spiked and sign-ups happened.
5) Positioning – Flatiron School went from maybe #4 coding bootcamp in the country to #1 based on our work and their high quality service.

We have crypto examples too:
- [CoinList](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/coinlist/)
- [Monero](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/monero/)

We need to do some more crypto case studies. Just been too busy doing PR work than marketing ourselves. Hopefully you understand we balance strategy, quality, quantity and client relations better than anyone else.

We would set Decred targets in our onboarding meeting. Something super easy to set now is Decred will be interviewed and get media coverage in the top crypto and mainstream publications. From _CoinDesk_ to _New York Times_ to Laura Shin's podcast, we can promise that Decred will gain recognition in all top tier outlets. We are confident about this because all of our clients (as you saw in our media coverage examples) get this attention. 

For events, we’d like to see Decred have an elevated presence. This means speaking at the high-quality crypto conferences. This does NOT mean having booth babes and going to conferences that are a waste of time.","4d36bf83c7bb5e9a107f6a1420120a157dc2f3045dc3e4d4bb49942fe3d5ca366ffd48ea039bb26042a25481326543d29f2c0a6c3b2740f961b098e945540405","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","38","520cfcb25e268dba89dfe0d62777b4f4f64acf75fa0f1ca45bd8985498cef65d183d9cad8a480f1b07b96a77ac425ae563ffa04dff8b511db016f76f4abcf10e",1540680285,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/38",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

My counter of materials who ""omitted"" Decred is currently at 74 and I made a few theories, but the main point is, if this ever changes it will be a big win for the project.

1.    Trey answered this on Reddit and our counsel is that we don’t believe you need two PR firms. But we have worked with other PR firms with other clients in the past (typically the other firm has a very specific focus separate from ours), and it worked out.

2.    We think creating materials that have maximum utility is important and sharing is going to be important to this campaign — and there will definitely be times where we should get the Decred community’s insight.

3.    We do quite a bit of work in Asia — we have a couple of Chinese clients, just finished helping launch Ledger’s Hong Kong office, and have helped facilitate interviews in Chinese. Additionally, we have relationships with the Russian media. I think once we get a good work flow going and we earn your trust and prove ourselves, we should as quickly as possible add that on. A lot of the U.S. media is translated and read by China, Japan, Korea, Russia, etc.

4.    You’re right — there is so much noise at conferences and events. A lot of our clients don’t even have the budget – or desire – to pay to play. We should definitely think about how to “hijack” a conference and develop an ""anti-event"" strategy.  

5.    Trey also just touched on this on Reddit. I think much of the work we will do will better define Decred and elevate awareness of Decred within the Dev community. But at some point, we have to think of more direct ways to get in front of devs. That will definitely be part of our campaign, and we’d want to listen and talk to you all to figure out the best way to do it.

Read reasoning [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/117). I appreciate this if it is the cause.

I agree that eventually proposal should be updated with decred team that will work on this.

This seems a good integration for the blockbook part as it allows easier integration into future trezor products. 

Although i am not sure about the trustwallet part of integration. Concerns being

- Its a ETH and dapps focused product, now acquired by Binance, not sure what kind of influence ETH devs/team and Binance have on the listing on wallet and exchange.

- As with every integration, what are delisting rules?

- Does support for so many coins/chains leads to bloated code and thus bugs? Can we have some kind of code audit report for security?

- Is wallet app going to be integrated with Binance exchange in some way? If yes this will be good for binance traders but will open up new attack vector imo.

I think the cost of integration and work required seems reasonable. Is the $50/month hosting cost is for one instance of Blockbook? Should we not have multiple geographically distributed instances to ensure smooth availability. I am not sure what monthly development entails at $50/month, can you calrify that?","2e1773e029bb6ff99a29262af5a1badfdbc31c57003f4dc0013e8b31b1030ebdc87bbe631de1fb8dc1dc5285eecf50e0d56412c8c5a826499c413592e09a0d0b","8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","5","4e372736dc56a499e7e935541abdddc60abc9554999b2a19a510078b0014dea15340fdc06a27eb54f6ace85e3922333b3b62507742833f4552b4d45106d49f00",1551901769,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571/comments/5",NA,NA,13,13,8,NA

The costs and work are best guesses after discussing with the trust wallet team.  Assuming there are contributors interested and qualified to do the work that we can sign up for this project we can do a deeper dive with them to shore up the estimated costs and extending hosting/maintenance fees.
The guess on development work is that there would be an irregular need to push a change downstream when blockbook makes major changes, so it might be 0 hours for months, but then 2-3 hours for a major release change to ensure compatibility in testnet before allowing the change.","1068b7773498866db19561fdf0fbb4573993132b80b5b7b088e51c670c386cf88232c8a6984f1332427e6a73b0894991abd0cc498d4d64a0ae75e21e1a30910f","6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","6","5307e63e1572791c07d6b2ac0ce45936aa6cae49be06e768ec10a7de446ac4e9d2f1f0a60e2dc76c5103f8aa61f9ba6facbe3fa3d7962d4100376836b6f89004",1551939108,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571/comments/6",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

Do remember very well when the exorbitant early sign-up fees were a big issue. Even though the rough consensus back in the day was not to pay for any (and this being a well principled decision as Pi wasn't released yet) worth to notice there was still a big and well reasoned push by various community members, traders, etc to even pay for example for Binance integration from their own pockets. Reason being as that would have likely meant a significant liquidity boost for the project at the time. Now the cost here isn’t a fee for sign-up but for funding for the development man hours. To me this seems reasonable and something exactly the dev treasury should be used for.

I rate proposals as this by whether it adds any value to the Decred ecosystem. Getting implemented into a number of different wallets (which are of decent quality) is by all means a good thing and grows decentralization. It’s also one of those small steps that adds up towards maturing the project in a longer run, which is needed before wider adoption.","500dfaba073feb62ca3b048b55fd0a1ff38819e042fa3b2d54957d1b0ec95457e0d38c5f3c673d087034673bcd41c1ee8356380ac7d3acdc7b092aeae7c7a30f","1602347ec404e3209b65b29240e9146eba135a99ce3d5f73f8ee5a9115bc534a","11","7e33d778cba021316de1d21ac27cc17cd8a227920dd7b86bd1453072c1a8913bc6c33c5d75788ca8e2c542b8b7bb4bde2f2b3c9fe2d9781961f9e948cdaabd03",1552615766,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2ababdea7da2b3d8312a773d477272135a883ed772ba99cdf31eddb5f261d571/comments/11",NA,NA,14,14,8,NA

Did [all other coins](https://github.com/TrustWallet/wallet-core) pay for integration and hosting their Blockbook instances?

Why didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?

> To facilitate balance lookup, searches, and other functionality without relying on a 3rd party server, Trust Wallet utilizes Blockbook, the back-end service for Trezor wallet.

This reads like to be autonomous, one needs to run the Decred full node _and_ Blockbook indexer, which is similar to self-hosting Decred full node and dcrdata today.

> The Blockbook development required for Trust Wallet will also allow for additional integrations with existing Trezor technology 

What kind of ""additional integrations"" this makes possible? This is strategic question - what Decred gains from Blockbook integration if Trust Wallet turns out unpopular?

How does current Trezor integration work if Blockbook still doesn't support Decred?

Blockbook is Trezor's ""territory"" so to speak, isn't it their job to code it?

> 2. Add backend/node support for Decred to Blockbook following the Blockbook contribution guide (to be completed and hosted by the Decred Project team).

I assume this means that Decred support is integrated into main/upstream Blockbook, not someone's fork.

Why does Decred need to host an indexer for wallet users? This is replacing one 3rd party watching users' requests (e.g. Trust Wallet team or whoever runs ""default"" Blockbook servers) with another (Decred team). This doesn't fundamentally improve the privacy of Trust Wallet DCR users, unless they host Blockbook server themselves. If the majority of users are expected to not run their Blockbooks and rely on 3rd party middleman server, this is an investment into another Electrum-like infrastructure that Decred used to avoid and went straight to SPV ""done right"". _(please correct if my reasoning is wrong)_

If Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.

There is no integration payment.  These are hard costs for development and hosting fees.

I don't know if all other coins have paid, the one project I was able to talk to in detail about the process did and also paid their own developers for the work that was required.

2. Why didn't Trust Wallet team submit a proposal themselves?

They aren't receiving the funding, there is no ""fee"", part of it is going to an independent developer in their community and part to a developer in our community(to be determined).

3. All the Blockbook questions:

I can't really address the ""what if"" questions easily or the ""what will"" questions.  Many other projects have worked to integrate into Blockbook, here is the list:
[Blockbook list of coins/ports](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook/blob/master/docs/ports.md)

The Trust Wallet team has already started their work in good faith and is a very popular project.  At worst if they are not popular this integration brings us a step closer to native wallet integration with Trezor.

4. If Trust Wallet implemented Decred's SPV protocol it would look much better to me.

We can't expect other projects to change how they do things to support our project, maybe if we were a top 5 project, but I think we need to be pragmatic about cooperation/integration if we want to be successful. Also although I don't believe enough testing/verification has been done all the wallet makers I have spoken too are unwilling to risk performance issues supporting project specific SPV/node implementations.

5. In case the Ongoing development requires more than 50 USD a month else the wallet is unusable for Decred, who will pay for that? If Blockbook devs decide to do a huge refactoring of the codebase, who will pay for updating and testing Decred part?

We would need to have another proposal if that were to occur to request funding beyond what is scoped in the proposal, or perhaps we will make inroads with Blockbook development through this cooperation (they have a fantastic team/product) who would be helpful in that event.

Imagine you want to sell me your used car for $5k and I offer to pay you in DCR. If I pay you with DCR using the last print as the price and your immediately selling that DCR would result in you receiving $4.5k that would not be a great offer. Having a MM there to absorb your sell order very close to the last trade price significanly enhaces the user experience, and you get your $5k.

Likewise, if you were a contractor and had some DCR you needed to sell every month to pay your rent and expenses it wouldn't be great if you put in a market order and the price dropped 5%+.

What having greater depth on the oderbooks does is build market confidence as people can get in and out more easily. They are able to immediately mark their position to market and don't have to worry about ""nothing but air"" if they try and sell.
In essence the stakeholders are socializing the cost of a better market experience for all DCR users and traders.","e3e83db005d5d38029bcdd3b3ed808750f2f0f384e6063137606d3701063a72dcfd6ab63059f9cd2251a154976a8a387546844a09ae3700859e4c15bd4437c0a","db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","4","35600a20ed4d1c6733c1c05476ba8596c4120255e965ee04103dd894ebd4349f422c69862eaa4d1b40571dda4fe1ec2b8a10426a64db84385be4278b40e81208",1565212617,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/4","jz_bz",NA,12,12,8,NA

1. Some information on prior work or case studies (third-party information can remain confidential if you are not able to disclose)

2. A reporting plan with metrics on progress.  Ultimately the measures of success would be meeting your target spreads, and overall increases in exchange volumes (additional liquidity and less slippage should lead to higher volumes as traders find it easier to enter and exit the market).  

It would also be nice to match-up exchange trading fees with transactions data from the exchanges to go along with your monthly invoicing for exchange activity.","3d3bbbbeade9dde128bcf20c7812154f51e36b8fb6b48b4d2de8175b4285f5f4cf150cea1cf275c8370b2c9a68c5ebfc3591af0373061b11b8c47b6ab332af0f","6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","13","fae2772ce534ae062200e7d3ae584be2d554d4586de704b0124bbd6e24c628289e40a20c93ec2ddf9a2e32a67d634a9b2301427c3d0550389733443788363501",1565273848,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/13","nottrunner",NA,11,11,8,NA

Depending on how much more trading happens on exchange once the program begins, its possible that the trader would be able to comfortably execute this order entirely on exchange. I would however recommend that a trade of that size be executed OTC for the best overall experience.  Our desk is willing to inventory risk of that size, and therefore the trader would end up with a very good price and less market risk.  We have routinely done trades of this size, and our clients were happy with the outcome.

2) We will provide reports on the total Decred volume (not just our trading) in all the markets we are participating in. Over time, this should demonstrate the increase in DCR trading, which could be valuable to the community.

3) To respect the privacy of our clients, we are not allowed to disclose who we have traded with.

In the interests of fairness, I have more or less the same comments and questions for each market maker proposal, but there are also a few which are specific to your proposal.

1. Could you estimate how much trading fees will cost per month or for the 6 month term? Could you put a cap on the amount the Treasury would be charged for?
1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. I notice on your website that the logos of Grin and I think Cardano are floating around, does that mean you have been engaged to provide this kind of service for GRIN and ADA markets?

Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?
1. You refer to the details of what would be provided as ""tentative metrics"" - what happens if you don't hit those targets?
1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $35k/month (including onboarding fee) seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:

2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If I2 provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if I2 can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about I2 and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $40,000 a month is - it is a option for I2 to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.

4) A Potential Project Killer-
As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum

I believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project. A killed project would not be a good SOV.","4bf98459777a5f166f8b78e55445a7d181e4d39bb1db3a8c5faaff0e83adedb135dbaea196bb5839a53d7a9ea624ea924b3d0c2a5f904d2914ec424a9bfa8e07","528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","25","e17b5d490eeaf05e8e605c1ec9d8f43650fb6ddee01ffddec61964b0a6a0a615a48ff54fb6d752cb8e22860c95b53e8f7c3d3319c739e5b1fa9e065558e5b90b",1565353872,0,0,FALSE,NA,"2eb7ddb29f151691ba14ac8c54d53f6692c1f5e8fe06244edf7d3c33fb440bd9/comments/25",NA,NA,16,12,12,NA

1) Thank you for your message.  As a MSB and primary dealer we are able to make markets on all proof of work currencies as they have been deemed commodities not securities in the US.  The rules you refer to are for securities.  Moreover, there is no clear regulatory guidelines either way regarding market making cryptocurrencies.  I appreciate your concern and will voice your thoughts to our counsel to see if we are missing anything.

2) Order flow and market making are two separate things, so I don't fully understand the point you are trying to make here.  The only point I can address is that market making is not the same as market manipulation.

3) There are many prominent DCR stakeholders who have traded with us and continue to do so.  I would suggest you onboard with us and trade with us if you'd like to experience our OTC offering.

The SEC has written that two cryptocurrencies are not securities.  Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The SEC  has ruled that several crypto currencies are in fact securities. Being a POW or POS coin has not been been determined yet.   

2) The fact that you want to provide bids and offers where the are not legitimate is the definition of market manipulation.  

Market manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the FREE AND FAIR operation of the market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of, or market for, a product, security, commodity or currency.

3) You are asking for compensation of want $30,000 - $40,000 a month. 
 Since you can't answer I guess that the answer is no one.  I have no problem with you being a market maker in Decred.  My issue is that you should not be compensated by Decred.  Citadel and Virtu make markets in thousands or stock, options and futures and they don't get paid by the company or the exchange.  Citadel and Vitru pay rebates for order flow.

4) 
Part A.  Overstock spend $107 million to defend itself from the SEC due to their T-Zero project.  Kin actually spend $5 million defending itself from the SEC.  There is a real chance that there will be an investigation on Decred if they pay for Market Makers as a Service.  

Part B is not hypothetical. The SEC firmly stated that they are watching the markets and watching exchanges and the participants. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019.

The risk to reputation and Decred viability as an independent project cannot be overlooked and must be protected at all costs.

a) Regulatory legality and compliance
b) The Ethics of Decred paying for such liquidity.

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure.

Based on similar projects in the market, I feel it a relatively low probability that DCR would be classed as a security and therefore lower probability of such adverse conflicts of interest.

I still welcome anyone with more evidenced information or opinions to provide it for the wider education and information of the community.

If we are doing to design it as an experiment, it seems excessive to go straight to six crosses, and foolish not to design in some controls.

For example, if we use a MM on both of the key crosses (USDT, BTC) that have all of the traditional liquidity on a given exchange, we won't be able to differentiate if an increase in volume on a given exchange is a general rise in volume that happens by coincidence during the experiment, or, as a result of the specific MM intervention.

If we do in fact want to run this as an experiment, then we need the best possible ""experimental design"".  

From the standpoint of ""experimental design"" there are many limitations, issues, and constraints with our setup.

That being said, assuming we can use ""trading volume"" as our dependent variable, then here is a simple case-based experimental design with 8 crosses evaluated in the data set, 4 crosses as controls, and 4 crosses as experimental, and creating max possible cross-case replication logic,

Experimental Setup:  run the experiment on four exchanges:
     - for the first two exchanges, introduce a MM on the BTC:DCR cross but not on the USTD:DCR cross (control) 
     - for the third and fourth exchange, introduce a MM on the USTD:DCR cross but not on the BTC:DCR cross (control) 

The replication logic in this design will allow us to answer the following research questions:

RQ-A:  does adding a MM produce the intended result and increase the BTC:DCR average daily trading volume for the two exchanges where the intervention was made compared against the two exchanges where no intervention was made?  

RQ-B:  does adding a MM produce the intended result and increase the USDT:DCR average daily trading volume for the two exchanges where the intervention was made compared against the two exchanges where no intervention was made?

RQ-C:  do all four MM interventions, regardless of whether the intervention was done with a USTD or BTC cross, consistently produce the same result against the control cross volumes?

RQ-D: if the intervention does produce the expected result, what is the %  increase in volume that we observe on each exchange relative to the control volume on each exchange? 

There are also other useful ""within exchange"" and ""cross exchange"" data that can be gathered with this experimental design.

By running this as an actual experiment, we can be significantly more confident in our conclusions at the end.  

My fear with the current proposals is that we would get to the end and our confidence in drawing conclusions might be quite weak.

Also, by approaching it this way, we can keep the costs down to four crosses, which should be ~ 2/3s the cost quoted for six crosses.

At best I had a vague idea of what a market maker was prior to these proposals.  My biggest concern is that I am not alone in my level of understanding, and that other stakeholders may be in the same boat.  

That said, in the future I think it would be ideal to a) launch an exploratory proposal similar to this one and b) focus on educating voters on the subject at hand during such an exploratory phase.  I think the examples of selling a used car here, etc., provide a good start.  But - this being so high-level, costly, and complex a subject, I would argue it’s worthy of more ELI5 for us non-finance/market experts :-)... maybe even an entire episode of Decred in Depth!  Considering how much has already been written on the subject, it may be helpful to listen to individuals in the community with expertise and stake in Decred discuss the various hypotheses surrounding MMs, illiquidity, etc.

Last, I think “jumping the gun” is a harsh way to put it because I feel like those involved with soliciting proposals from market makers had Decred’s best interest in mind while doing so.  This is something we can learn from and it is better that a situation like this happens sooner than later.  Props for retroactively posting this proposal and all the work you have done so far and thank you to the MMs who have already put time and effort into their proposals and discussing them with our community.","8d6d761ebdd27e4fc728e68ae2377f03de40a126445f5cf17f8db246eb76da85fe7d26aa2da24ffbf83b620900eddda28ee791ab13d8d181dc28782e75419304","a38a5b0287e87afb4b5363e1069b20d3abd3d7e98e757a70552753505d38dfd6","6","f0f7f5c0295d01fad9f3756993abb9aeb79242aadac5e434de238daf6048d44a8ab0fc2e811ddccb46769d257c18cfa5c1651141795efc818c0370731f63fa01",1565477695,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/6","cagochi",NA,13,13,8,NA

Every currency, store of value, tradable asset needs liquidity. Market makers provide that essential service.  I'm focused on assessing our options and selecting the best value from those that have come to the table.

Nothing is without risks.  I recall the initial process for selecting our PR firm that was somewhat contentious, its yielding dividends now.

We are all part of a grand experiment.  Iteration is a process of trial and error.  I think this experiment is well worth the try.

I think the proposals thus far have gotten a lot of engagement and we are on the path to getting a final list of proposals that we can vote on.

While I think a lot of burden should be placed on Market Makers to provide answers to our questions and refine their proposals, I also think anyone planning to vote should also do some individual DD to make sure they have all the information they need to make a sound decision (which ever way they actually vote).  Some independent research on google would be a good idea.

I come from an econ and equities background so I'm pretty clear on the value proposition of Market Making done right, and how vital it is for supporting liquidity and free flowing markets.","b66f9e6e6c1b520921f290a181b140c3c477b42e47a7eabb333d6e35bc6132b3035b1109f0072d47c04ef096abab86d870228967f56a052a41879eb18104f000","6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","7","3e2abe525c47eea48ea0d199b95ffc3be6293e47b216800e4ea8c1770c8d4ae02c164345b6d8f27c16eec2e6ef477e7ea54ec21fa1642ec52e62abf4b77b4009",1565477812,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/7","nottrunner",NA,19,18,9,NA

I now think the risk is relatively low of adverse backlash following my further research and discussion (again, i'm not an expert in regulations, just my view).

MMs will only provide maker liquidity, they will be passive in the market and will not be placing active trades. MMs will not be actively buying or selling, only providing the opposite side to other peoples trades.

Furthermore, many of the issues Jango raised (following my further research) are strongly associated with securities, not commodities or currencies. Whilst I do not have the experience to give anything other than an observational opinion, Decred seems very unlikely to be classified as a security given the degree of decentralisation and coin distribution mechanism.

I will be supporting this vote and my preferred MM moving forwards in light of this as the benefits to the project are expected to be high.","8ef6d360b9496cee969002d1989ef6ccbf74874f057f723a7b73a386cd3b92dbc8a5eaba0472736d7de9a0b1dc17bfefeca0ef5148b8d6411e1e659cce3d5906","ee69df0bdf51299b5b2db07c0ae8eab99968632632eba228271a68c661142323","8","91fc3d80f406c7353b8f7a814053053ea1dd022b6fa747f857eef8d756f17351e18d071dfe63d61727797e6fa98a863181d67dc42b037e4e4a43e118fedba20a",1565478017,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/8","_checkmate_",NA,15,14,9,NA

At this point, I am not convinced that hiring a MM is a good idea. The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

The acceptance of a **PAID Market Maker Service** is very concerning to me.  I believe that a yes vote will lead to an inquiry from regulators.  Any inquiry from the regulators will cost millions in legal fees, and will likely drain the treasury.  I am wondering how many programmers will be willing to work for free.  

JZ - stated earlier that that the liquidity is for small traders. However, most traders are not going to move Decred more than 1%, so how does the community benefit small traders? Oh, bye the way, payment to a market maker to provide liquidity is the definition of market manipulation.  It does not matter if it is a stock, bond, or commodity.

Every day Decred naturally adds liquidity to the liquidity pool as blocks are created.  So over time there will be more size and more liquidity. 
 Miners are natural sellers and they (provide offers or they hit the bid), since they need to pay for equipment and electricity.

New listing potential with Coinbase could be derailed if Decred pays for market making as a service.  Why you ask?  Coinbase will need to decide if Decred is a security or not. Paying for market makers as a service will likely put that decision into (no / limbo category).  Poloniex has already Geo-Fenced Decred in the US due to regulatory uncertainty.  The ethos of the entire community is being put to the test.

That said, I definitely am in favor of running the MM experiment, and provide some further thoughts below.**

+++

I've been watching this discussion unfold for a few days, and I believe the problem with all three proposals is as follows:

- people are saying ""it is an experiment"", but the proposals are not set-up with the scope, timeline, or cost structure of an experiment

- the term of 6 moths is approx. twice as long as is necessary to show what the results will look like

- the scope of 6 crosses is is twice as many trading pairs as is needed to observe the impact

- the cost of setup fees + $40k per month is definitely not anywhere close to the zone of an experiment

Why not 3 crosses for 3 months?  And priced at $12k per month, which would cover 2x half-time personnel?

The capital for running the MM function isn't even being provided by the MM (it is being loaned by a miner and paid for by the Treasury), so the MM doesn't have a cost of tying up capital.  I don't see what other expense they are bearing other than time and materials?

Why can't MMs come to the table with the same 'fight club' mentality that characterizes the rest of the Decred contractor community and prove they can add value before asking for professional comp levels?

Personally, I think this current batch of proposals should all be voted down, and the MMs should sharpen their pencils and come back to the table with  proposals with a scope and timeline designed to actually serve as an ""experiment"" and with pricing that basically reflects an attitude of ""please give us a chance to cover our costs and prove ourselves.""","1cedad9ef022bb37e3f972e31795851db6010a4a069010676bb51b343415d2b6444f63887d7d7fbfb7cfd4e617ee456600fc2e977072392334150e2c2e21f707","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","19","0137837f4bb2abd4afea62a2ac323d1ff66d3f3db4cddef08a28ae708a429f9eaef02701e509fd3fb8e905a44913aed0f97b9510c9ae6ea853015739a3704d0a",1565497205,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/19","betterfuture",NA,22,20,10,NA

But, if this truly is the case, then average daily volume should rise as a direct consequence of MM involvement, right?  I mean, if we've solved the order book liquidity problem, and there truly is pent up interest to buy and sell, then avg. daily trading volume should clearly rise.  

If avg. daily trading volume doesn't rise w/ the buy and sell walls showing up, then we can conclude that the real problem is a lack of interest to participate in the market, and not the lack of order book liquidity.

If there is no interest to participate in the market, they paying a MM to setup buy and sell walls to increase order book liquidity is a wasted expense.

+++

My hypothesis as to Decred's lack of liquify and volume is as follows:
   - the core community is very strong, like a cult, and they are all staking, but it is a cult that is operationally incompetent, and can't figure out how to market itself
   - since the general market hasn't really heard about the project the participation rate from typical run of the mill traders and speculators is abysmal 
   - Decrd's market awareness scores 1 out of 10 versus Bitcion's 10 out of 10;  see:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=decred,litecoin,bitcoin%20cash

Anyways, running a MM experiment should help us to understand better which of the two problems we have (a) lack of order book liquidity, or (b) general lack of awareness about the project.  If we run the MM experiment and average daily trading volume rises, we can conclude we have problem (a) and the MM proposal fixes it.  If we run the MM experiment and avg. daily trading vol stays static, then we can conclude we have problem (b) and we need to focus funding efforts on broad market awareness.

**Summary:  Setting up walls won't resolve anything if really the problem is that few traders want to trade due to a lack of market awareness about the project outside of the tight-knit core community.""","b8cc85979be21dfa5762e8c24e5215714ef7713863e25fb23ffb955244729bf59788934282e5c20c69534ef4b64bad0864aa8ee23d721054aaaec4a181b94f09","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","20","8ba954b1218ef3b75e39f2bcfb1909ee37c5f226d23af4fb88ebf68e3189949b0b4fec904ef5455b45c93e35f4e220b91f01a66dd591f6d76d128b50df76e20c",1565499619,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/20","betterfuture",NA,12,11,9,NA

Decred either **IS** or **ISN'T** a security. A paid market maker service will not make it tip one way or the other.

If you believe Decred is a security, no current exchange should have listed it or should trade it. The implications would be major and we should all rethink our participation in this project and the implications of doing so. 

If Decred isn't a security the regulation you refer to doesn't apply at all and you are suggesting to vote no based on unrelated information.

Nobody is currently in position to say definitively if Decred is or isn't a security  because current regulation is incomplete and purposely vague regarding CC. What we can do however is use the SEC framework, past comments and existing laws regarding traditional security assets and  apply it to Decred to make an educated Guess.

My personal conclusion in this regard is that Decred is most probably not a security  (or at least, that hundreds of projects are quite a lot more at risk of being securities well before we even begin to consider Decred to be a security) I believe that major definitions of what are securities would need to be changed before that happens.  Thus personally, I will act and consider Decred not a security, unless an official regulatory statement is made and say it explicitly is.

Poloniex geofencing Decred,  while adding,trading and promoting an ICO at the same time should be enough convince anyone that their action have nothing to do with fear of regulations. Just like you should not make your decision based on coinbase's decision to consider Decred for listing either.","51937fde84400fbff6f2a6466f18dd38e79bf131d7ad6aab014b5da9aad882f689361ab63e2e98a5fa20678c2f33e24ee2e90ada5094a9ec605e6a50909b050e","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","21","67741275354aaf2dd6131c1039841b07f49d56ac067f26e93533fb231b9a0ce617ce3e6c3dfa030d7fca3e2ea1aefb266ad4b87c7da2094763cbccfe09b4890f",1565532255,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/21","nnnko56",NA,21,19,10,NA

- **Cost** - It must be similar to other heads of expenditures, which from cursory research seem to be around $20-30k/month or lower.
- **Transparency** - One of the contributors (jz being a good candidate) should have at least view only access to trading operations of MM. Also whatever proof that would be provided if a regulator or court asked to prove no unethical practices are happening should be available to the community as well, in form of monthly reports(?).
- **Opt-out clause** - It should be possible to terminate the contract if desired results are not visible in 3 months with review happening every 3 months.
- **DEX** - Option to add DEX pairs when it launches.

My main motivation to consider a MM at this moment in time is to get research data and finding out with some degree of certainty that introducing liquidity on order books leads to better market interest. Other than that my suggestions are an attempt to reduce strain on treasury and achieve transparency/accountability and reduce need for trust.","6947bd514c921d70d094886d9075f008d91c6a1d8ae8cf7d5ed33e1078f1f4da0dad3dcc0172682374a600975ffa311cf89bcc33bbabcfd59aa6567a2a25810d","98cf480835aabf91c43c2913db1849d0c80b947f1fe1392804150a633582a84f","24","b559b818a8ca979b704737679b3b9541f5fe715a077f133f57ab5b2a5b1beb6d42160bb640cd29ba7bb0747e21c90482defc730dd66c5fd452932745557c2007",1565541837,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/24","sambiohazard",NA,14,13,9,NA

Decred needs some sort of an engine to kick-start trading of an asset that has a massive hodling properties. Great problem to have tbh) But I understand the market and its a very mean place! In reality when an asset has a great value roughly 10%(possibly even less) of all circulation that is on the exchanges defines the price. So when a majority 90% is hodling for the long term the minority which are day traders and speculators define/discover the price short/middle term. Exposing themselves to a much greater risks when in short term or swing positions. Im 100% in favor of MM coming to generate day trading.

1- There seems to be some concern over whether or not Decred is a security. I tend to go off of the decentralization requirement those was used with Eth, it is decentralized enough to not be a security. I have very little to no concern Decred will ever be labeled a security. 

2- DCR has no liquidity. None. I can’t even sell 10 DCR at times without moving the stinking market a little. In order to attract more attention to Decred then we must have liquidity. Will you provide it by placing your DCR, BTC, USD up on the order books? I will not.

3- Concerns of wash trading and manipulation. I think it is possible to detect if these activities are taking place. I would like to see a clause added that would end the contract if detected.

My bottom line is that market makers are needed for Decred to advance where we all know it should be. I will be voting accordingly and giving my support for the MM proposal to IterativeCap. Vote for what you feel is in YOUR best interest.

I am not happy i had to spend any Decred to make this comment. What can i say, I love my DCR. But there will come a time when everyone wants to exit or increase their position. As the market stands now, its not possible unless you OTC. For people like me, with not nearly enough Decred to use OTC trading, a MM would be a tremendous help.

The discourse so far has been extremely healthy and both sides bring valid points to the table. My comments will hopefully illuminate why we thought it was prudent to work with an MM as well as clarify some of the misconceptions that are being brought up.

The need for an MM quickly arose as I began speaking with a number of institutional investors here in Silicon Valley. While Decred isn’t yet a household name, most researchers who spent time looking into the project were quite intrigued and were quickly interested in becoming stakeholders. Time and time again, I heard issues around DCR’s liquidity. The inability to acquire a large position wasn’t the main deterrent, but rather the inability to get out of a position once acquired as well as what illiquidity said about market sentiment. Investors know many times markets are forced to contract, and when they do, the most illiquid assets behave poorly. Not because of fundamentals, but purely because the market can’t absorb the selling pressure. Similarly, investors have to weigh current liquidity in their research as a measure of sentiment and demand. 

This doesn’t necessarily mean that MMs are being brought in to help the wealthy, it is merely institutions who have been most vocal about the problem. The lack of liquidity affects investors big and small, and it seems like contracts are the most affected as they actually have to liquidate DCR to pay their bills. Not having liquidity + constant sell pressure from contractors and miners forces the price down and does not instill confidence within the broader market. 

Another driving factor in our pursuit was the fact that an asset positioned to capture the SoV market needs liquidity. If an asset isn’t investable, I.e. liquid enough for investors to move in/out of, it can’t compete with other SoV contenders in the market. If you look back at Chris Burniske’s work on the institutional investors case for BTC, he notes that inevitability is one of the hall marks of any asset, and as such, we must prioritize DCR’s liquidity if we expect it to be an SoV. This issue is particularly exacerbated by the fact the DCR has such a high stake rate. 

In terms of cost, something that should be stressed is that everything is malleable. Costs aren’t fixed, and we prompted the MMs to create proposals that were flexible so that stakeholders could decide the appropriate number of crosses, market depth, uptime, etc. $30,000 within 2% on each side seemed enough to facilitate retail investors moving in/out of positions with ease, but my understanding is that the MMs are willing to make this number $50k or even $15k, it all really depends on what we think is best. 

Lastly, and we’ve stated this before, but all of the firms chosen to submit proposals are high quality firms with a lot of reputational skin in the game. For context, Altonomy just raised a large financing round from Polychain Capital, Grapefruit Trading was started by the former founder of Cumberland, and i2 has been a crypto OTC desk for a long time and active DCR stakeholder. We only engaged firms who’s values line up with those shared by DCR stakeholders.","5ad5f79ad19aaaf06f72b8725c9822c3ef3d2a5151f1fb046ac6ac6f33869b52f37b77b3d03052b75beb633c62c7522f37579642c4f88079c1029c706fdbd00a","107a5db445996608df8bd7cecfb6b3e41d74fd6c659916becb4e54167849a96e","29","6bc98d749769293faedb6c805eb521cf8a1816e1309e35271c025b523621d0e28b6a82bddc736a311b38361df14d3abf2d1ff0de26b712398db2807b2a841609",1565646704,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/29",NA,NA,20,19,9,NA

I believe I am for the idea of a paid MM now, as I have been doing some thinking on how Decred's PoS element drives the need for non-standard liquidity. In BTC or XMR, for example, the only cost's associated with keeping funds locked up in orders is the potential for losing funds due to exchange issues, but in DCR, you also give up potential earnings on PoS rewards.

The other main portion of your sovereignty lost when locking up DCR in orders on-exchange is the ability to vote and have a say in the future of Decred as a whole.

Because of these two reasons, owners of DCR are incentivized _not_ to provide any liquidity, as it ultimately costs them much more than on standard PoW chains. As such, I believe paying a MM a small portion of the treasury income is a great middle ground, and an excellent way to keep all of the benefits of staking DCR, while also being able to increase liquidity of DCR across the board.

The key here to me is that we, as stakeholders of Decred, can guide the MM process all the way through, and ultimately shut it down if it fails and or turns out to be unnecessary.

Tl;dr -- Because of PoS drastically reducing liquidity and increasing costs associated with keeping DCR locked up in orders on-exchange, a paid MM is a great thing to explore.","a85e41b64cc05b75ceeafe89c194ce1bb0fb764118deefbb367579dbae22b1fbdae04b160faca8b2b876a10c6ac301922eb19bcf206eff10ae75d3c1e523480f","18f6cb98e06dfd5153ccafc105e7b6ab812bcd1ac71b62829060cf49670ea791","34","e5bf371b62ba8b7ced02085bdd57f5c1d19c49b082290482484afc9aba655c13c87b1fd56128d2c48ae180639186efdbdefcbdd4eb9ba3ecd9f2ebe3b368c90b",1565701918,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/34",NA,NA,16,16,8,NA

I generally believe that creating liquidity at various pricing levels will attract traders to the asset -> who create additional organic liquidity (and volume). With the increased liquidity and volumes, the asset will become available to a new class of investors, particularly institutional investors with strict liquidity requirements in their holdings. Where today, even if these investors had an interest in Decred, would be barred or limited in the size of holding due to the lack of liquidity available today.

It is clear to me that both sides have the long-term best interest of the project in mind. I am of the belief that we should take heed of the critiques of professional investors in this space and make efforts to improve our liquidity.

IMO cryptocurrencies should not hire DMMs. Market makers must remain neutral from what they market make and ONLY crypto exchanges should bring them on the market or they market make themselves for profit. Traditional exchanges do allow companies to pay MMs for market making as well. A company is not a currency tho but I think its nonsense as well.

It pointed out this risk factor you mention in terms of Decred falling under securities regulation if it participates in creating a market/supporting a market for Decred. My article agrees with your fears and validates your argument, there is a risk here. 
But in my opinion the risk is worth taking for multiple reasons. The first is that the SEC is currently going after much bigger and easier fish then Decred (KIN). They do not have the resources or manpower to go after every project that may or may not be a security. Secondly, they are focusing on ICO tokens for the most part. Third, because of how the Decred project is implementing this MM, by this very RFP, and by through seeking stakeholder consent first with politeia, we have a much stronger defensible position in case of regulatory intervention. If this decision were unilaterally implemented by the directors of the Decred holdings group, we would have issues. But that is not the case here. Fourth, the SEC is one regulator of one country. Decred is a worldwide project. Fifth, even if we do receive a penalty from the SEC against the Decred treasury, we could potentially vote on whether to pay or not (that be a strange proposal). Furthermore, we may be able to decentralize the treasury funds control away from Decred Holdings Group LLC before they are able to compel that entity to pay a penalty. However, this could mean the directors of the LLC could still be on the hook in the worst case. But in the best-case scenario, we could point to the now decentralized treasury as proof that Decred is no longer a security (Ethereum did something similar).
we should not ask for permission, but forgiveness. The spirit of cypherpunks has never been that of cowering in fear of regulatory reprisal, or to ask for permission to write code. We should not seek it now here either.","4e34d5a24ef213edd05c4e5e1e95207a8f1622a050e4343ff01d82afc5101fd700f5d19093f7ca479753d7ae87b5afe589d29c44ab04a6d671036f8539745100","7be2e523007f116ac22e0d04a715c0ff4e7834d0b85cd656577730efd10a2281","44","059ef23a7a59815c5af482694467cc5a2f6585aaef9924dc24dc5a41c26f10b5d5fb2702186c694bfd3c45928ecd8795a28bf30487d87532c5a6c64d3eb6c708",1565896009,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/44","fiach.dubh",NA,14,13,9,NA

1) I do not see what recourse decred stakeholders have if the MM behaves in an unethical manner. Obviously stakeholders can create a proposal to break the contract but that has repercussions. This topic needs to be better explained in my opinion.

2) It has a potential cost of 7.2-3.6 million dollars a year. That is some serious cash. At this point would it not be cheaper to add 2-3% to the amount of decred the contractors are due? I understand that this also has to do with decred as a medium of exchange. But at this stage decred is rarely used as a MoE. Does paying a MM millions of dollars annually actually improve this problem?

1. RFP being done after the fact despite it being discussed prior to MM proposals showing up.
2. RFP voting start date was revealed even before proposal was up on Pi. I saw 100s of tickets being bought 2 days before voting started on this proposals. I can't say and am not saying that there was some kind of internal fixing, but knowledge of voting start date certainly allowed someone to stock up on tickets.

3. Proposal was not updated with proposed amendments suggested in comments and my comment and some others were even left unaddressed despite getting some upvotes.
4. There is continuous talk of how opposition is only a vocal minority, which very well might be true in terms of voting, but i think valid concerns and reasonable amendments should be acknowledged and included regardless. It could be a unorganized majority of many which we need to encourage to join the discussion. This is necessary for decentralization.

In summary whole process looked very rushed, hap hazard and somewhat heavy handed. After 1.5 years of behind the scene work, why is there need to complete this in only 4 days of wider discussion. I wonder if this is going to be bulldozed through because majority supports it or they have the votes despite some valid concerns being raised.

The speed at which a proposal progresses, in terms of comments and voting, is entirely up to the proposer, and they risk a proposal not being approved by moving it too quickly between these stages.

It is interesting to see you attempt to frame this discussion as a question of ethics.

Risk arises from 

a) the treasury not being fully decentralized and being in the form of an LLC currently (which a regulator could view as a clever AP slush fund/entity).

b) if decisions are unilaterally made by an AP (luckily that's not the case here, since the community is actively deciding these issues).

c) an AP participates in creating a market for Decred, which is literally what Decred Holdings is doing by funding a MM. The point is, an MM will be paid by the Treasury which might or might not be an AP.

MMs were debated a lot and I'm really happy to see this issue being resolved through Pi, but just one week of discussion?

This issue is as big as hiring the PR partner or deciding whether we want to fund the DEX. Let's speak numbers:

PR had cost $120-150K for 6 months. 2 proposals were published Oct 20-21 and went to vote Oct 29. It was coordinated behind the scenes, it was poorly announced via the tiny #proposals room and felt rushed. Lessons were learned: we realized that we need RFP process for such cases and to significantly improve announcement campaigns. We also discussed [longer discussion periods](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/117) for bigger budgets.

DEX had cost $250K for estimated 6 months. This was the best handling of large expense so far. Concept was introduced as early as [June 2018](https://blog.decred.org/2018/06/05/A-New-Kind-of-DEX/) so everybody had enough time to digest it. [RFP proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) was published Feb 4 and allowed a ton of discussion. I had enough time to [reflect](https://github.com/decredcommunity/proposals/blob/master/dex/analysis-bee.md) on all pros and cons. Once the discussion mostly died down it went to vote Mar 5. I think 2-3 weeks would be fine, but 1 full month didn't hurt at all.

Fast forward through DEX spec, [DEX dev](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1) adjusted the cost to $230K and time to ~1 year. Published Aug 7 and vote started Aug 12 - but that's okay because everybody had a ton of time to sync up.

MM proposals have cost $250-300K for 6 months. 3 proposals published Aug 7, RFP published Aug 10, RFP vote started Aug 15. This is a _new_ topic to debate formally and just one week for up to $300K?

I don't know about others, but for me the need for MMs is even less obvious than PR or DEX. I do want to dive in, educate myself, understand why it costs so much and make the best vote choice, but it takes time.

Since this is just an RFP, there is still time to learn and discuss before the real ones go to vote. I hope they won't be rushed like this.","87084e9e6001f32ae77145d185ee6e6727f81144e320b0490331ec180b01f8d5e291c298ba05e2d41b979cb7d0c35e4e3a63285e4e777bb614df19258774bc0a","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","55","cb5c3093d7f4bc253e8b0ad09d1d1814d1fc8d3934a47424d6e6ad13c8d9a7da81e97098d8fe85baa192afb906b6b69d96db044659f9ff11323de8f7d4d4cd0b",1566076714,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/55","bee",NA,17,16,9,NA

I heard in traditional markets exchanges are the ones who fund market makers. Exchanges are in a unique position to audit MM's work because they have full access to all trade data. Why this should be any different in crypto?

Do all coins pay for market making?

Do any crypto exchanges pay for market making like they should?

While trading on a retail exchange I learned that you can get burned. In rare events you can get burned _heavily_ and _quickly_ and never sell/buy back.

What are the failure modes in the worst cases, who will take the damage in case of a ""black swan"" event at the exchange? E.g. if a huge dump or margin/stop-loss collapse, or if the exchange gets hacked?

How MMs handle bull runs? Bear runs? e.g. if their DCR sell side is fully bought out and the price never falls back (it will mean a ton of DCR was sold cheaply). Conversely, if the BTC buy side is fully sold into and the price crashes without recovery.

If MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?

Why ""just placing buy and sell orders"" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated? (similar question [here](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/19))

Don't we simply have low liquidity for other reasons? e.g. the sell side is lacking simply because the price is wrong, and it will wake up at a higher price.

>Will there be a legal contract with the MM? If yes, what entity will be on Decred's side?

No, the final Pi proposal will be the agreement. They will have a lending agreement with Alternity but there's nobody in charge on our side with the authority to sign deals on behalf of the project.

>In case the MM manages to make profit during his activity, will it go back to Treasury or make a discount for the next month?

Great question, we can negotiate this but since I'm not willing to share in potential losses they may incur it's probably not acceptable for them to share profit. They will not be making a market with the intention of having net profits though.

>Will stakeholders have control of which exchange to provide liquidity with? In particular, could we ask the MM to deploy it on our DEX?

Our DEX will not likely be ready before a 6 month deal expires but when it does if we decided to renew a deal DEX MM could be a stipulation.
The crosses/exchanges that have been selected have been chosen for strategic reasons. We can get into those in more depth in the comments of those props. We also need flexibility so if we get any major listings during the 6 month engagement we can switch to operating where we feel it would have the greatest impact.","370f7e58eff32b8b193146de06531ed9b98b285876240024efaf9bf20a237078e44d0db2e488e8c7a40ffcc076b34b6eba8fa9f16aeed27e93cdd6d14220160f","db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","63","b228da23357da920c8f7597c321db24e55bb5b2b1c58043060ef66a73a0cc860540033a7d762002b08a1cffc251618dc54ead682966951e48539b3960f617907",1566171664,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/63","jz_bz",NA,11,11,8,NA

Most coins would not ever admit to engaging a MM. We have very little data for comps.

>Does a period of MM have any long term effect, i.e. if we decide to stop it after 6 months, will we return back to our thin books situation?

Yes while active the MM will make for a more orderly market and encourage people who would have otherwise not taken a DCR position to feel comfortable dipping their toes in the water.

>Don't we simply have low liquidity for other reasons? e.g. the sell side is lacking simply because the price is wrong, and it will wake up at a higher price. Or the buy side is thin because of the general lack of interest/awareness like noted here?

You are correct that price fixes everything. Part of the problem is nobody want to be the person that makes the price rise sharply. A MM helps to smooth this process.

>If we are talking about institutional players, why not provide this liquidity via OTC instead? I guess OTCs have less custody risk than retail exchanges? Do institutional investors use retail exchanges at all?

DCR is actually well traded OTC but MM would have less impact there, large players transact in size and the types of support we're talking about would be a rounding error on a typical OTC trade.

>Isn't it good that the big boys are not entering? Isn't it better to have DCR distributed across lots and lots of small fish?

Amusingly enough the groups that have been most vocal about engaging a MM are larger players who are mostly done buying and want the market to be less scary for small players to enter and exit.

Tighter spreads, lower price volatility, and ideally higher volume. I think i2 estimated to hit $20k/mo in exchange fees they would need to be doing $20M of volume. That would be a resounding success in my view.

>Any chance we can start small, run it for a few months, read some reports and get a feeling that MM is indeed helpful before ramping up the expenses? Echoing this comment (unreplied as of writing).

Yes but we need to balance that with something that can actually be effective and is worth doing for the service provider.

Proving causality is always hard, I can just imagine price rallying or falling and people assuming MM is amazing or the devil.

Exchanges are in a unique position to audit MM's work because they have full access to all trade data. Why this should be any different in crypto?

It shouldn't but the reality is exchanges have the power and don't care about low volume coins.

>Do all coins pay for market making?

I suspect every coin in the top 20 by market cap has MMs operating.

>Do any crypto exchanges pay for market making like they should?

Probably, but likely only for coins like BTC that do tons of volume already.

>While trading on a retail exchange I learned that you can get burned. In rare events you can get burned heavily and quickly and never sell/buy back.

MMs will need to manage risk in a way that protects them from major price swings.

>What are the failure modes in the worst cases, who will take the damage in case of a ""black swan"" event at the exchange? E.g. if a huge dump or margin/stop-loss collapse, or if the exchange gets hacked?

The lender bears the risk for the coins lent and the MM bears it for price moves.

>How MMs handle bull runs? Bear runs? e.g. if their DCR sell side is fully bought out and the price never falls back (it will mean a ton of DCR was sold cheaply). Conversely, if the BTC buy side is fully sold into and the price crashes without recovery.

They need to buy it back and it would come out of the fees they're charging us if they get put in this position. Essentially they could lose money doing their job.

>If MM is confident that they can provide liquidity without burning money, why can't they use their own money?

This isn't directional market making and there's a cost to acquiring the DCR necessary to make the market. In short there are easier places to make money that don't involve complex inventory deals.

>Why ""just placing buy and sell orders"" cost so much? What makes it so expensive? Isn't it semi-automated? (similar question here)

The expensive part is the fact that you are potentially incurring small losses and exchange fees. The bids/asks are all spread out in an automated manner.

If we onboard those who were blocked by liquidity, what kind of people will we get?

Exising stakeholders myself included managed to obtain DCR regardless of all the barriers. For a certain subset, the core values of Decred were far more important than liquidity issues. If a person is considering Decred but is ""blocked"" by liquidity, he can't even what, wait a little or market buy? It means for him these values are less important. He might barely care about what Decred is about.

In other words, isn't this liquidity barrier similar to the barrier for becoming a contractor that filters out those who aren't serious or don't care much?","3e3a48ee7039f280d50e11fd5f0701ddd9f848b66c0726744846c39455f5d83683e8b691859dc0c5079a180528e920b56f07289d9708f4fde28545a64a5caf07","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","73","b857e67107f3abb62882b5531f7b2e5cd4850db88938731c590ed8f1659ecf751f39acffbbff8f733a151f12436266fa0fd42ee5b37ecf1be0beaf97e192fb0f",1566302153,0,0,FALSE,NA,"30822c16533890abc6e243eb6d12264b207c3923c14af42cd9b883e71c7003cd/comments/73","bee",NA,12,12,8,NA

DCR is already available for on Easyrabbit it seems, and the relatively small price for the ""upgrade"" comes with some real benefits to Decred, which do come at a cost to this exchange.

Specifically, (1) widget integration and (2) lower fees for users, come at a cost to the exchange and have obvious benefits to users of DCR.  Arguably, this is true for social media promotion where there's only so much room for tweets about the coins they support.

On the other hand, paying to put the DCR logo in their ""featured section"" is arguably of less value and feels a bit against our values.  Is that different from social media promotion?  Maybe not much, but the reach of social media is important for informing/reminding those already interested in DCR that there is another service they can use.  But featured placement on their homepage does not seem necessary if you come to the site already knowing what you want to do (hopefully buy DCR).

What can go wrong with this proposal? ""Constant promotion"" sounds a bit like spam everyone all the time.  Also, the mere acceptance of this proposal could reflect poorly, if it weren't for the redeeming fact that 30 DCR is a modest sum that is actually appropriate for the added services.

Another consideration is what volume does this site have and how much benefit do these lowered fees offer DCR user, in aggregate?","1d356d26cdd18b5a6e2a85b8fd50ccbfbf52795672e2c79d417ea437e1afa14b1e54072c11b722efe4a7f8015b852e946c7aa420431c01035ffc3531d2042e00","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","3","08da21270be1f34f2cfc8a091abd16369d6afbdb58f0d9312f1a8703fccc2cbee15ba8737dbf29d5b3fd7cc7e43760706b2b6a54924e4dee64d547d8b9c6b80c",1541017899,0,0,FALSE,NA,"34707d34b09c3ebcf0d4aa604e8a08244e8f0f082c0af3f33d85778c93c81434/comments/3","chappjc",NA,10,10,8,NA

What could you possibly do with those 30DCR that you couldn't do for free?

In other words, if you can do it for as low as 30 DCR, why can't you just do it for 0 DCR?

It seems it wouldn't go to ingo paying labor, hence my skepticism.

My first thoughts on such listing fee propositions have to do with understanding if the exchange actually has justification for the fee.

A regular exchange asking a listing fee just to list an asset, when fees from that assets trading bring profit to the exchange, is a huge red flag for me.  They should list the coin anyway since the alternative is to get no profit at all (this is what most respectable exchanges seem to do).

What I see here is an exchange that has already listed the asset and is offering a lowered fee among other things.  Now, it is a valid question to ask if the initial fees were already too high, or if the lowered fees are lowered enough.","39283014355dc59fededa67229b1a6445c453641c1cd2b8314cc02b6232a54831612caafe721464f3aa63c09c2789e36332e885e7990f0af22f7c4e539d40505","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","10","4eb3403593af1ecfa18dffed082aeb1ce72a2eea7e1da637dbdb7c1d6761718e6305bcece39a4c2e38ea00bb3bd20659a1c7b0ac41094e9055b57cb344996b00",1541036762,0,0,FALSE,NA,"34707d34b09c3ebcf0d4aa604e8a08244e8f0f082c0af3f33d85778c93c81434/comments/10","chappjc",NA,9,9,8,NA

"1","add","417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1","3","Good questions.  There are notable similarities, but also major differences, between Sparkswap and the Decred DEX (dcrdex). Here is how they compare, in my understanding:

Sparkswap has a dedicated wallet that must be funded for each asset.  Any wallet that you fully control may be used with dcrdex.

With Sparkswap, atomic swaps are done on the Lighting Network (LN), not the assets' blockchains. The initial implementation of the dcrdex will involve atomic swaps on the mainnet blockchain of each asset, but that need not be the case in the future.

To place orders with Sparkswap, funds must be ""committed"", which is done by opening LN channel.  With dcrdex, users merely identify UTXOs with sufficient value to fund the swap(s) that would be needed to fully fill and order, and sign the order with their account private key.

**The Sparkswap ""Relayer"" is analogous to the Decred DEX server process.  It is operated by Sparkswap (the company), while the dcrdex may be run by anyone.  The Relayer does not appear to be open source, except for the Relayer's gRPC proto definition for clients.**  Perhaps I have just been unable to locate the Relayer source.  Please correct me if this is incorrect.

The Sparkswap ""Broker"" is the client, and may be run by the user, but a Broker seems to be able to serve multiple users. A Broker can accept many types of orders, including market orders, but the Broker turns them into one of two specific types of limit orders: new limit orders for the book, and fills/taking orders.

**The Sparkswap Relayer does NOT perform order matching; the Brokers do this.  As such, there are no guarantees that users' orders are matched fairly.**  The dcrdex server has an independently verifiable epoch based pseudo-random order matching to ensure fair trading and combat a number of abuses and gaming of or by the exchange.  It is not clear to me how Sparkswap addresses order races coming from different Brokers.

Also like the Decred DEX, makers and takers are required to remain connected otherwise their orders will be cancelled.

The Sparkswap ""Relayer"" charges a 0.1% fee for placed orders and filled orders (0% during their beta period). The mechanics of capturing the fee is unclear to me.  dcrdex has no trade fees.

On Sparkswap, ""Trading Deposits"" for each order are used to disincentivize abuse, while dcrdex will use registration fee. Each order has a 0.1% deposit.  dcrdex requires no deposit for each order.

Front-running seems to be mitigated in Sparkswap by only allowing limit orders on the Relay (market orders only exist conceptually on the Broker).  This leaves much to the Brokers who may operate in any way they like.

Sparkswap on spoofing: ""Spoofing by sending orders and cancelling quickly before someone takes the order is still possible -- this is common on all mature exchanges, and extremely difficult to enforce any prohibition against without harming overall efficiency of price discovery.""  Although, spoofing by failing to execute an order that is filled is disincentivized on Swarkswap by the loss of the order deposit.  The Decred DEX penalizes frequent cancels following a cancellation metric, and similarly penalizes failure to perform the swap with loss of registration fee.

""Painting the tape"", or colluding parties creating a false appearance of a certain price, is disincentivized on Sparkswap with trade fees.  On dcrdex, epoch based pseudo-random order matching makes this risky to attempt.

**Order suppression by the Sparkswap Relayer is not prevented.** The dcrdex requires that orders be broadcast to all clients, and eventually to all servers once server mesh operation is implemented.","0f040c8aeff69ec5a8a5e4e8b01908aa0a0805169cad2f41b01d2b333694128e0b6bbb53c551dbd07986ae8531e42a8099badbd6cc6a300b1b90a00f76c7cb08","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","4","f40b10c001ac4defb19f78e237ed1d7ffd35a59305a21a92f04501a43909edead4ef13977f022e3b7db76ba88d9ecd52418b890dd9f567552e848c7b6cf09e05",1565213149,0,0,FALSE,NA,"417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1/comments/4","chappjc",NA,17,17,8,NA

Once the onchain DEX is online and we have a decentralized mechanism for price discovery, this could be fed into the routing decisions of LN nodes in a multi-coin LN, allowing transparent cross-coin payments.

One hypothetical way to realize this would be to have channels marked as cross-chain with a swap fee expressed as a % from the average price of the last DEX epoch and nodes use this information for routing decisions based on the max fee for a given payment.","da9ffacb6f8958b3c4eb36d5cecf0d498ed642b22ff567063eb7e2bb24cd84fe7852287dafc963e5b9341c3338577841de70e1031078dda33d241b3cde2b7907","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","5","a706c7f1ab12a7d1aff302f943efd526061e5a2161fa611c3d129601aa2e43640c4133881d94aad4b23df0b0eb28b0acb9dd5fa5092149e890cb07ab1417ec0b",1565268828,0,0,FALSE,NA,"417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1/comments/5","matheusd",NA,15,15,8,NA

One thing i wanted to ask was that afaiu client needs to remain connected for full duration until the order is fulfilled and there are penalties if orders are cancelled due to disconnection.

The scope of this proposal is a minimum viable product, which includes a CLI client, although a simple web UI may be a by-product of development.  **The real vision for the Decred DEX client is something very much like Decrediton --  a great GUI application written with the Electron framework for cross platform compatibility. ** Given successful completion of the work outlined in this proposal, the Electron GUI client will become a high priority.  It may even begin in parallel with the later stages of this work.

Great question about the requirement for consistent client connectivity.  As I mentioned in my response regarding Sparkswap, this will be a requirement so that users maintain complete sovereignty over their funds at all times.  However, depending on the state of the order and/or swap, there will be _short_ grace periods to allow the clients to restore their connections.  Still, I expect services to be designed to help with connectivity issues, which may be especially problematic for orders with long lifetimes.  I imagine trustless solutions for such services will be engineered, although I defer speculation to others with more expertise in advanced contract scripting and LN capabilities.  However, I see the use of a (securely-hosted) headless client and dedicated trading wallet as a fairly straightforward solution.  In fact, what I'd like to see is the ability to drive a headless DEX client process via the Electron-driven GUI much like how Decrediton may use a remote daemon.","5f13725f790e7d170798a950fc1101c98e095029e9dd5b485f9b76e63c21ed9cc969ef975394a7ffd09b49f648ba02ac9f0d301e0fd8cac728ae0ef793d2200f","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","11","b32b5e149cbfc09736428c82983b96e281693852dec8346ea8fe27db23ee6c3478de30c02620e7f0742108deb7efa283ce0915be7ccabad274a61b258ff27e0d",1565547680,0,0,FALSE,NA,"417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1/comments/11","chappjc",NA,12,12,8,NA

Some questions:

- Will email be optional to register and trade? More generally, will it be possible to register and trade without any third parties (email, phone, Google recaptcha, etc)?
- Will there be a public API for archivists and researchers to mirror a full local copy of historical order and trade data (like git clone)?
- If the above is yes, will the API also allow incremental sync of such data (like git fetch)?
- Will the client have features to mirror and inspect historical server order data?
- Will it be _possible_ for the researcher to detect if the server quietly removes (and no longer serves) select historical order data?
- Are client tools to detect server misbehavior in the scope of this proposal?
- Will the non-order data be public, e.g. ""Server X banned pubkey Y for reason 'bad behavior Z'""?
- Will the client have unrestricted access to the wallet like `politeiavoter` (give it the passphrase and it does all the job), or will it employ some method to not have the passphrase and instead ask the wallet to sign certain data (like in the protocol I suggested [here](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/720))?
- Why Electron framework and not something lighter like Qt or nucular or fyne as used in [godcr](https://github.com/raedahgroup/godcr)? I realize the GUI is out of scope for this proposal, asking in case you have any thoughts to share at this point.

1. **Email** will not be used in any way.  Registration involves just submitting a public key and paying the registration fee.
2. **Public API for historical data.**  This was actually a fairly contentious issue in drafting the spec, but we settled on providing an HTTP API just for certain resources to prevent clients using polling to manage their trading.  Historical data would certainly be fair game for a public API, although it would not be suitable for a real time view of activity on the DEX -- that's what the websocket is for.  Regarding **incremental data retrieval**, that is a reasonable feature, which I can see being supported with URL query params (e.g. `?from=X&to=Y`)
3. **Historical order data inspection by the client** would initially amount to the standard charts and order book data you get from most exchanges.  Additional functionality could be added as the client evolves.
4. Regarding the possibility of a **server archiving or outright censoring historical data**, it will always be possible for a custom client or service to archive the orders as their are broadcast to all clients.  However, I do like the idea of hashing and timestamping order book history to prove an uninterrupted history.  Such client tools are not in scope for this proposal.
5. **Publication of non-order data** by the server such as account/pubkey bans, did not see a great deal of discussion in spec drafting, but I appreciate the need for showing proof of administrative actions for example.  Note that in a server mesh configuration, it would be necessary for such actions to be broadcast so that all the servers will be processing the same epoch and order book.  As such, third party archival of such actions similar to the previous issue of history archival would need to be supported, although development of such tools is not in scope for this proposal.
6. For the client to facilitate UTXO locking for order placement, and transaction signing for the swap process, the client will need full access to the wallet containing the funds to trade.  However, there has been discussion about account-wise wallet locking/unlocking that would help with security here.  There will need to be more research on this topic, but note that the wallet and client are both open source and running on your machine rather than a third party service.
7. As far as the **GUI framework** is concerned, consider that Go and other languages now target WebAssembly (thus providing interoperability via a JavaScript API).  Considering that Electron is essentially a JavaScript engine, this is potentially an efficient combination.  Regarding Qt, I personally don't wish Qt (or C++, TBH) development upon anyone these days.  I'm not as familiar with nucular or fyne, but I have found Electron based apps to be quite nice.  That said, I'm not the best person to be commenting on front end issues.","5ec374462ee3e58bd75af7569a2daf62df837727b305ba281bc8eccacd8b5b067bd66d84e19048273639673230bf8c2b4eaf8aa3ff7e3bb0e1685a62915a5707","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","16","765a6119a58331b27516363ea93b8e77d6ed4a5a19466bd382f35ff5ea8d7a62065978448875878c6bb7f7c62e11e98514dbd935008e47d7d08505acd2c23508",1566248700,0,0,FALSE,NA,"417607aaedff2942ff3701cdb4eff76637eca4ed7f7ba816e5c0bd2e971602e1/comments/16","chappjc",0,0,0,0,0

Currently supported coins did not provide any founding for few reasons:

1) This was a first batch of currencies. Now wallet is usable so you can check it out before making any decision.
2) All coins other than BTC and ETH were a low hanging fruit that were added because tools and providers I use support those, now each extra coin would require an extra effort.
3) Those coins did not have a voting/proposal/treasury system. I really love the idea of a community driven project and I was actually advised to post my project here to see what happens.

Your concern does make a point though and that's why I tried to keep it reasonable.

I would also note that if my wallet wouldn't be open sourced I wouldn't bother Decred community with this proposal.

As an example, if DCR is trading 30 dollars mid market. 

i2 is bidding $30 - (1% of $30) = $27 and offering $30 + (1% of $30)  = $33. Their market will be $27 / $33

Grapefruit will be 2% wide meaning that our bid price - ask price will be $6. This could be $27 / $33 (same as i2), $30 / $36 or, $24 / $30.

We specifically chose to word our offering this way because this gives us the flexibility to adjust our pricing relative to mid based on our inventory while still maintaining the same spread. From our previous experience trading in traditional markets, this is one of the key ways to manage risk and inventory and minimize trading losses. The same amount of liquidity is provided, but we are less likely to be stuck in an unprofitable position.","928f9a75e905cb2ce27b6d96942a0ba12f92ec89ef2f2ec51b86278adcc1f0e1722662738613f74f4e34f656f1e216ab91bf22a739667a40b468452cfc895d00","4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","5","24ecec61b4cc50b235b3d512086181e68f127a8ffdf5500ee903fb0b7697d178942ac67624f7a6271cce921cc0b2b91bbc5e9d23b8ff045fca474340de7f5f07",1565270427,0,0,FALSE,NA,"4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/5",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

1. While none of the current proposals would allow someone to enter/exit positions of greater than $1M USD in one click, it would still greatly help the situation. Generally when large players want to put on a position, they use advanced execution algorithms. Even in the most liquid of assets (think Apple stock), positions are not generally entered/exited in one fell swoop. The most basic of these are TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) and VWAP (Volume weighted average price). Most hedge funds have a team of PhDs working solely on reducing slippage. By increasing the liquidity available, these algorithms will be able to perform significantly better to reduce slippage form a target price which could be nough to sway a potential investor.

2.) I'm glad that you brought this up. One of the first things we made clear to the team was that we would not be able to guarantee any volume numbers unlike some of our Asian counterparts. We are based in the US and are a wholly owned subsidiary of a traditional finance firm. As such, we do not engage in wash trading or any activities that are frowned upon by the CFTC. We will only guarantee width/size/uptime. We're very experienced in market making in traditional markets which are generally much more difficult due to the increased efficiency of those markets. I'll elaborate more in the next point.

3.) Our firm is fairly young (1 yr old), so we've only done a this a few times under the Grapefruit name. We currently are market making for a few exchanges. We've previously supported the exchange launch of a new project as well. That said, in our previous stops, we've made markets across some of the most well known exchanges in crypto and traditional finance. Our founder (Mike Komaransky) was the founder of Cumberland and was one of the first market makers on BitMex and a handful of other exchanges before they were the household names that they are today. In former roles, we've also participated in structured market making programs in Euribor Swapnote Futures and Sugar futures on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (now part of ICE - owners of Bakkt) and Eurodollar Packs and Bundles on the CME. We've also provided liquidity in numerous Fixed Income and Equity derivatives markets in an unstructured manner during our high frequency trading roles.","f351ef869a2b9ca183b4adfab7c20a8da77bf8b235190ba9541926870470e1642c5bcae4950790de94320085f724b7c1bbc2b17b074d35df95b724cbca7eb101","4e745973d789988916efc0bedc426a5f253910ef37255fbe650a5bcfd39663fc","6","bed5fa5230947cdb814f8ed2e440e7e2387fdeb2fcdd98262c0b18c30ebf9d6f7e24d8a42bd878f868e86e45f0a4c2860e94a9a5747db6cc258a1af73d66f10c",1565271978,0,0,FALSE,NA,"4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/6",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

In the interests of fairness, I have more or less the same comments and questions for each market maker proposal, but there are also a few which are specific to your proposal.

1. I appreciate that you have stated in another [comment](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/13) that you would pay for trading fees and these would not be charged to the Treasury. Is there a down side to this? Would you be taking any action to limit trading fees? Is the 80% uptime quoted relevant here?
1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. 
1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?
1. What happens if you don't hit the targets for uptime or depth?
1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $30k/month  seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.
1. Is the DCR loan referenced the only loan you would require?
1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal. I appreciate that you have proposed an interest rate for the lender and provided some calculations, but it would make things easier if each proposal represents a complete package.","ce4051454893cb27e306620d27135895d8cf53fac30d8629d99dceaedb7ef1a6af2937cf304dbd381741d3a3178b9d4b5c902ea93de1bf74f0935b34fb7aaa09","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","19","6fb7d1c7fa8307827914396fc05d12b1b310aa7a2cd0a5993da45939137cc2a5ed33b656405fd327462c7a0f5224e4bc48da6c6849a5cc312f7c248e59fc100e",1565297019,0,0,FALSE,NA,"4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/19","richard-red",NA,11,11,8,NA

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal are illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning.

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250 FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process. Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and (3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act. The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4 FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:

2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow. The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow. If Grapefruit provides such amazing service. Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service. Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation. Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great. The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service. We look forward to seeing a list. Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free put / call to trade around? That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book. If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.

4) A Potential Project Killer-
As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say. The regulators know a few things really well. First, they know trading. Second, they understand markets and market mechanics. A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not. Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project. Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time. What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation. Say goodbye to the Treasury. Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left. The answer is no. Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated. Don't believe me? Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019. https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum

I believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project. A killed project would not be a good SOV.","48090e1e33e621821981ba50955822c123ec176a1ace89b3874b772ad45978e3794fb7b6a267bb7efcaa563104e626b5b45f5882e1dca36b7e41379c902cc304","528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","20","d910231e0351c35777c7a238f884b60fe6a38035991b3480fdaae430b23a813c6e8e6e373a48b8ee89cb83be4b9615ba5608e02e376ea91612a63925f6009b0b",1565353734,0,0,FALSE,NA,"4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/20",NA,NA,14,12,10,NA

I am concerned at the lack of the option to vote for none of the MMs. With the current voting choice, this option is not catered for and in effect, we are all assumed to want a MM, the question only being which of the three we want.

>  [Quote from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cm2uw1/decred_only_needs_one_market_maker/): 
""It was suggested that we approve the proposal with the largest Yes - No vote tally, as it should be the choice most voters are content with. Should proposal A have 70% approval and proposal B have 65% approval, proposal A would be approved and proposal B would not. If everyone understands this, they are free to vote Yes on as many proposals as they are happy with (vote Yes on all if they want a MM and don't care which one it is). Politeia will be updated to allow multiple options, but until that time we'll have to build social consensus around the best way to handle these more complex votes.""","9ff85470b18f91d7577126c58643cf4f9d863e9c102b8459d798d4df5b4169f09349b7d5a2b065a0165a6f10666413c5dd02d14eb5cc002794341616ad92aa03","5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","22","10d94306c22167f9593aed731c89ed0f119c09c6416d9186bb2f2a10a58ac6c04fe9aa5b605e99d9225d61a49ff7ded609709032f027b7b3835433eb9fb52000",1565406976,0,0,FALSE,NA,"4becbe00bd5ae93312426a8cf5eeef78050f5b8b8430b45f3ea54ca89213f82b/comments/22",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure.

Based on similar projects in the market, I feel it a relatively low probability that DCR would be classed as a security and therefore lower probability of such adverse conflicts of interest.

At this point, I am not convinced that hiring a MM is a good idea. The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

3) We will adjust our markets according to our position. If we have no net DCR position, we would likely make our market symmetric around what we deem to be the fair DCR value. If we are short DCR from other trading activity, perhaps we would adjust our quotes so that our bid is closer to spot than our offer, to encourage other market participants to sell us DCR.

> In stark contrast, stake pools, or Voting Service Providers, under the proposed vernacular, never take custody of the user's funds and do not offer reward sharing.

As for VSPs - would want to continue to explore terms. Is there any concern that it's close to ISP? That's what popped into my head when I first read the proposal. Obviously a lot of negative connotation to the term ISP and many elements that are at odds with public blockchains. Would worry about new members of the community having to learn the term. Voting Pool seems like a cleaner term to grasp and then it's on us to educate on the functionality of VPs and how they differ from a PoW mining pool.","4e040c1fb51ecf169a1d209a966f278b5e0ea0b851531e1e3a16480781937e2b3a818ca880e6e191eeac1c24e52387f623113dc41cffc84a2e4f8f056bd12401","ea908909ff25fe89285aeb54df68f39a9c43b988cd7e30ee0bf3c895baa25d2c","10","d412c161b11baacd12828ba5976694267d0fe239d254146d09430f98fa853e28c50c3dfa31500a961fd11269b6bff20eda37fe53d36fef3be40ba266f82ab20b",1540046390,0,0,FALSE,NA,"522652954ea7998f3fca95b9c4ca8907820eb785877dcf7fba92307131818c75/comments/10",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

I've personally stayed with simply proof-of-stake or staking for some past 2 years regarding design outputs.

Glad this proposal does not include the any ruling around terms for ""participants in staking"" or ""staking"".

The work amount related to key platforms – such as stakepool main repo, dcrweb, voting dashboard, decrediton, dcrdata and potentially some of the communication items (digital and print) is not that significant. Shooting from the hip, I would imagine some 30-35 hours the most for the coordination, implementation and related tasks for 3-4 people. Most certainly this will be somewhat on-going work for a period of time, as it will be difficult to get all the stakepool owners to update in a coordinated manner (simply too many people) as well I imagine some odd instances may turn up with time.

My main question is about metrics & measuring success. 

IIRC, when you were asked about metrics in the Reddit AMA, you pointed to articles published, etc. but isn't that missing something? How can we assess engagement, how effective those publications were? I know this is very tricky to quantify, but in this post you say:

> Decred’s awareness and visibility have significantly increased in the last six months, 

... as this was a fact, but how do you reckon? In the AMA you provided anecdotal examples, like your own personal experience form conferences, a personal feeling that awareness is growing,.. but as a stakeholder I'd like to see something more tangible and numerical... what metric do you think would be relevant, if any? Pageviews on decred.org? Google Trends? Exchange rate?

Or perhaps that is outside the scope of Ditto, should we direct those questions more at the marketing (Dustorf?) instead?

If awareness is growing, surely there must be some kind of measurable effect, that awareness cannot just exist in a vacuum, it needs to result in some kind of action: either Googling about it, or downloading the client, or buying the coin...? The metrics that are accessible to me do not show any significant boost in awareness, so all that remains is the anecdotal & feeling that it is growing, but how can stakeholders assess that? 

Because like you say, DCR is often not even mentioned in many articles about crypto governance, which is very strange since we should dominate this conversation, as you rightfully state. I certainly don't blame Ditto for that, but awareness obviously hasn't grown **that** much?

I'm aware Rome wasn't built in a day, but as a voting entity I need to try to find the weak/critical points, the good things speak for themselves anyway. 

You write:

> Now that it has broader awareness, 

As if this was already common knowledge agreed upon and established.
But what is the evidence for it? 

>Empower community

Yes, I especially like this part. There is potential there.
I'm thinking DCR PR&Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.

Good luck & thank you!","b2d140657430e7723ef180d4a7bacc67c1c88c101d01ae922513447245b1d681f1dd5735de03f91d885f3f6093dd7605e587614bf2a8e93478d2b1b9efb25f06","f7c880cacb4bb456c2cb81b64e3ed0ae9ca1af4126bf4c31d0d5f738317a2e01","1","65b59cefcd860872c19dd62089c09f895e0a49b5880db8fd37467be22604a7d8b0696a46982829c34100f4bb79101fd7bf7406c14b38aa1d0575da64098e9e06",1559149292,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/1",NA,NA,16,16,8,NA

We agree we should think about how to more closely measure success. Ditto spent the first 6 months proving ourselves, and we hope we’ve shown what we can do and that we deliver on our promises. In phase 1, we stuck to the basic metric of how many stories, bylines, and tier-one coverage we generated for Decred. Anecdotally, people tell us all the time that they’re seeing Decred everywhere. Just last week, a fund that’s also a future client approached us to take a position on Decred. We at Ditto are seeing it first-hand because we’re deep in the community everyday. We’ve also talked to community members like JZ and Jake, who say they’ve noticed an uptick in awareness at conferences and meetings.

But you’re right — that doesn’t tell the whole story. 

In the first 6 months, an important metric for increased awareness was that Ditto has introduced 50+ of the leading crypto journalists to Decred. As the gatekeepers to the entire crypto community, journalists’ awareness carries immense, long-term weight, because in many cases their stories are people’s first touch point into Decred. When we first started talking to journalists at the end of 2018, the majority of them had never heard of Decred. Now, every single one of them is not only aware of Decred, but is well on the way towards associating it with staking and governance. The seeds have been planted, and we’re starting to see the results. 

Awareness is an important strategy in a bear market. Now, as things start to thaw and we prepare Decred to be in the best position possible during the bull run, what numbers should we be looking at?

In the next 6 months, there’s an opportunity to dive into more detail. Of all the metrics you mentioned, the most readily accessible is page views. Many of our clients have websites, home pages, or reports they want to drive traffic to. What are the priority web properties for Decred: Decred Journal? Decred.org? Medium page? In the proposal, we talk about creating more educational materials on the website, then getting those links placed in stories and driving traffic to those materials. One of the benefits to creating resources and making sure they’re socialized strategically is that we can measure clicks. The better and more sophisticated web presence we build, the more chances we’ll have to tie those to our PR efforts and measure web traffic. Ditto would need view access to Decred’s Google Analytics or other backend analytics so we can assess exactly how many people are clicking on backlinks in stories, which backlinks are most popular, which countries readers live in, etc. 

Other potential metrics include Twitter following, participation rates on Politeia, number of community members, number of contributors, etc. We’ve even talked about measuring awareness and sentiment at conferences. When people come to the Decred booth or approach a Decred rep, are there 3-4 questions we can ask to help us as we think about measurement and moving the needle on awareness/understanding of Decred? Metrics like these might be trickier because they’re affected by many variables besides just PR, but they could serve as long-term benchmarks. Ditto doesn’t have full visibility into all these metrics, so we would need the community’s help with gathering this information so we can measure our efforts against it over time.","1eb7302e27e230f446a2280361622856f12a92c8977eb4d7c3168d419c79de88cea5206d34ea0ced407eda3bc5eac1924e048165ef568afdd501ab6b2aa8f304","c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","2","b37ccc5d6d64344ce40d7aeb96eac8ee67ba0b926f991a25320d0d1399644feb36079fa4340bc42438778497c966efa647683c9758899a96039100b2b046c000",1559153885,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/2",NA,NA,16,15,9,NA

I do believe Ditto has put in a lot of hard work, and also realize that breaking everything down and reporting it is probably not a good use of resources (Decred has a similar approach, though more transparency and reporting at higher levels is being implemented). This general lack of visibility into Ditto's efforts does require a lot of trust from the community however. I would echo others comments about picking a few meaningful metrics to report on, and also ask if there's any info you can provide re: resource allocation. Ditto is a small (if growing) PR firm it appears, and presumably has other clients. It is also presumably pursuing other business in parallel with this proposal (I would hope so). These other clients will naturally compete for Ditto's internal resources, causing variations in how much the $25k/mo goes to Decred initiatives. Is there any high-level update you can give as far as Ditto's general ""availability""?","1bc074ea06e925398be09cbe420c95c0d712489aa3d816d0253ac0829800b3466246ee41f77eb1942353a3eca48260ea1871aae4c13aaa2974b772fdbf4b4402","1690025d33db0ec5cfdb37e7054ed93c1b4327dd394ee7b593034645bd0c59b3","16","8f9b4c38d6b000f78465307b2d05873c6b819148d0f83092503727292f4205b060242507b76b0af3b3c92364614e423e631a7a382980864bd3b1cda8f472920c",1559248540,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/16",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

I am also feeling proud about the WSJ piece, great job getting that article done!

+++

Within the AMA video, I love the focus, intensity, and focus on metrics.  

I appreciate seeing Decred contractors putting their full heart, soul, creativity, and passion into their work, and I ""feel"" this energy coming through in Ditto's AMA.

Hearing the level detail about what is happening, the thoughtfulness about segmenting the community, and also the focus to win that comes through in your voice gives me confidence in your commitment to the project, Liz.

Trey, your focus on Tier 1 coverage gives me reassurance that you are focussed on ""upping the game"".

+++

I am going to vote yes for phase 2, but with the following caveat:
    - I believe the $25k per month is too high relative to the Tier 1 coverage you've achieved to date 
    - as such, I believe the community needs to keep a close eye on this contract, and consider giving notice and cancelling the contract within 60 days if we do not see progress in the Tier 1 media category

+++

If I was negotiating this proposal on behalf of a private company, I would offer $10k per month base with a bonus structure for success against the KPIs, and with that structure, I'd be comfortable to let the contract run the full 6 months.

Hypothetical bonus structure: 
* $10k per Tier 1 media item, 
* $4k per Tier 2 media item, and 
* $1k per Tier 1 media item;  
This reflects the fact that a Tier 1 media item will be viewed by 10x the eyeballs of a Tier 1 media item.

+++

As a thought experiment, I wonder how hard it would it be to draw up a long list media outlets (maybe 100 to 200 or so), and to rank them into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 categories against what we know to be Decred's vision and goals? 

Such a list would be helpful, not only so that as a community we can measure successful performance of the contract, but also as a means of helping Ditto to know which media relationships to focus on curating to achieve Tier 1 media placements.","6f380ea88d216af2227e8aaf5d5c34f7e6a752122244d7505e513ff6dc9175cf70c8b8eee23048ef5d80499283a89c2d836906cc46fabd8ca3ecc20e84850f0a","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","17","808154f0302eba5b36e4395420f20c142ec0c101ba4eac60008b176b209601b01841c553f6e38231f5533fab0b525141c662384f3b24ebc38819856ee91ba50d",1559249178,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/17","betterfuture",NA,13,11,10,NA

>Yes, I especially like this part. There is potential there. I'm thinking DCR PR&Marketing needs more out-of-the-box approaches, they have demonstrably worked in the past.

I think this is a relatively low-cost, high value opportunity. The community regularly produces some pretty amazing (often unpaid) content (e.g. long-form think pieces on medium, slick infographics, etc.), and often those producing it don't always have the greatest social media reach. Amplifying their output could be effective. Also, the Open Source Research program has produced some interesting, original research that could be utilized more.

First, let me tell you about our approach to PR compared to other PR firms. Ditto is all about fewer accounts and more attention. At other PR firms, you could be on up to 12 accounts, many of them on your own! We do the opposite, which is why people call us the anti-PR agency. At Ditto, every account has a team. And each staffer is on no more than 4 accounts. Additionally, Trey tends to overstaff at Ditto, meaning we are staffed up for where the company will be in 3, 6, 9 months. Other PR firms tend to spread everyone thin and then desperately hire up when they get a new client. Not us! This means we are very available for Decred. 

Decred is one of Ditto’s most important clients (if not our most important client) because we truly believe in the long-term vision of the project. Talk to any one of us who work on Decred, and you’ll immediately see why that approach works and just how ingrained we’ve become. 

That’s why we’re intentionally dedicating some of Ditto’s most experienced senior talent to this account: Trey, our CEO, has been heavily involved in Decred since we started working together. It’s rare for CEOs to be involved in day-to-day client work, but Decred has been an exception from day one. Leslie is a former Forbes journalist who has written about Decred in the past, has deep knowledge of the crypto space, and specifically came to Ditto to focus on working with Decred and other crypto projects. Margaret has years of PR experience running the gamut from big tech to tech startups — and she’s become very integrated into the community. Lastly, I (Liz) am in charge of our San Francisco office, where I’m 100% focused on crypto — primarily Decred (here’s some proof: https://twitter.com/liz_bagot/status/1131305762544705536). 

I hope we’ve proven through our constant engagement in Matrix, AMAs, and interaction across various platforms, that we are available to the community 24/7. I think our results speak to that availability.","aeb2594aee77a595d5ff135f189f6d5da65bc9d764829923caf1fa2fb223bf062e9b287a59205a37e6c22bf5efae7b749df614865331153be1057a84e42cae06","c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","19","3fe8bbbc41a3d32867adff7edb2e947ee6f800e9a42a95daed7276aea786584233684e36eac5c4a240ee5682e78da176a13d8717a03349ce48e091693c4d7202",1559252242,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/19",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

It’s important to point out that what we do is far more than just media relations. We are writing content, doing messaging, media training, events — an interdependent web of activities that create an ecosystem of broad awareness. And we keep the community updated on our work. Media coverage is easily measurable and visible, though, so we understand comments like this. And the good news is that the additional work we’re proposing is measurable and visible, too.

Let’s hold onto those bonus incentives! It’s not something we normally do, but it’s an interesting idea. Maybe we see how the next 3-6 months go first and revisit. We like where your thinking is at, though. 

Absolutely keep a close eye on us! We like being held accountable… and being recognized when we deliver. I think you’re going to see even more amazingness from Ditto as we see a bull run coming. This is an awesome time to be working with Decred, and it’s an important time to have a PR firm that’s keeping you out there in front of your target audiences. 

You make a good point about creating a master list of media outlets we want to target. We’re glad to draw up a list and workshop it with the community, although it’ll probably be closer to 50-75 outlets, since there aren’t 100+ that cover crypto. We’ve had lots of discussions with various community members about target outlets, but we know priorities can change, and we’re happy to work off a master list that we can check off as we go. We’ve already hit important targets like WSJ, Forbes, The Block, Cheddar, etc. — lots of top tier that we didn’t expect to hit in the first 6 months. The next bull run will help us check off more on the list as outlets start covering crypto with more frequency and enthusiasm.","84031def4f2db9fccd9ca4148333facdd9beafd3b0a5d7d886c357b3763aaa32a09b4fe07a28c3bba7ffa6c08041766ac04cb25ff2d41f0c127d4e15c12c9f0a","c6e4610c5a6c12076673c93c8817bb10b9bae651d36d5f6fa97d73b465d8e051","20","b74a6872d9d6e3c06bfa0f76fe628855dca9f0ad64c7ed6f032512d0db1105ca8376e476de0f9ea2d053186f398dc04faf2d470ceabc1b40d947d3ecebaac904",1559256861,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/20",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

**However:**

The whole proposal seems to be incredibly US-centric. While I understand that Ditto is based out of the US, are there any plans to reach out to other partners/community members that reside overseas or are in non-english speaking countries? 

I love the idea of aggregating educational materials to one place, but could it be possible to extend that initiative to also include translation of that documentation in a few common languages?

This is not a problem unique to Ditto or Decred, multiple projects struggle with this. However, I think clear initiatives to create a more **global** community would be incredibly meaningful for the project.

As we fit the various pieces in place, the English language marketing is improving substantially, and this process is portable to marketing work in other jurisdictions.

It has been said that ""you go to war with the army you have"", and that is precisely what Decred is doing: using its US-based assets to increase English-language awareness about the project.  We have less assets in other jurisdictions, but we are beginning to more effectively deploy them and get results.  There is a certain amount of critical mass required to make an effective marketing push in each jurisdiction, e.g. several people who are fluent in both English and the local language that can attend events and increase awareness within their locale.  We are starting to reach critical mass for Spanish and Mandarin communities, so you can expect to see more on these fronts in the near future.","dbfcd88eba2b9ccf714c2d74744cea7994b702f6f42f7f14bfa5441316f61b71a82163e6d08bf16dfbda372744cbef44d5aa4788517e7491f33e3415b4f9530d","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","24","f3ab8569e98720d7692f4941dca2e4dfa65fdd919e2ec138dd3b6eb3b7ba17096fb1c6c7bbbe5c96b7dffa2a21bdf3db44474881dfc4efb72c67ab12d821440b",1559311929,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/24","jy-p",NA,11,11,8,NA

But I do have a few accountability questions:

How many Decred contractors received talking points, messaging or other consultation help from Ditto?

Could these contractors please voluntarily let us know there thoughts on their experience with Ditto.

How many Decred contractors received Media and messaging training?


Could these contractors please voluntarily let us know there thoughts on their experience with Ditto.


Is Ditto aware of the complications surrounding the SEC's recent guiding Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets, and fallout with the geo-fencing of Decred by Poloniex. If not, please keep this on your radar, as it may become more and more relevant. Please include it as a part of your crisis communications...I believe the implications are much more serious then what has been mentioned thus far.

I think there will be much more on this in the coming months ahead. And from me, I'll be doing a write up on the risks, consequences and implications of this event soon. 

I'll probably have more followup questions and suggestions too.","04bd6058c2ff42563facfb86548d7fed6395ff33ccbf7d8bca6eee280cdb31038a82aa8416899b3a52000d8ef49179cb6df9218d76b3c6ecccfa1f5c3cfb370d","7be2e523007f116ac22e0d04a715c0ff4e7834d0b85cd656577730efd10a2281","27","82020c5705dcd982b04e1ae91f98883254489c85ac6fe03d2c5d5b4d0406f5ff7869318a37be216cb2863f18e719cdf1130616302c92c83591b0d5b1e9fcb900",1559339198,0,0,FALSE,NA,"52ea110ea061c72d3b31ed2f5635720b212ce5e3eaddf868d60f53a3d18b8c04/comments/27","fiach.dubh",NA,12,12,8,NA

We’ve provided messaging, media training, and talking points to 9 Decred contractors so far. I will let them speak up if they want. I can say with 100% certainty it was helpful and valuable. It was also great to watch anyone from Jake to JZ think about how to conduct a good interview and get better each time with regular guidance from us. 

As we mentioned in the proposal, we want to empower _anyone_ in the community with an interest in advocating for Decred to the media. There’s so much power in the community’s collective intelligence — now we just need to harness it and organize it by equipping people with the messaging and knowhow they need to engage in a public setting.

Yes, we’re aware of the Poloniex delisting and have been discussing it with the community over the past couple weeks.

Making sense of these numbers is hard:

* On Twitter we saw 1-2 quick rushes of new followers that were washed away with several purges of fake accounts.
* Reddit shows slow growth of subscribers, but page visits were in decline. I heard other subreddits experienced the same during the crypto winter.
* Telegram gradually declined from 4.6K to 3.6K, but it might be a good thing. I guess it also wipes bots and shills. The old bridged #telegram room was the spammies place I've ever seen.
* Facebook grew a bit from 3.1K to 3.2K.
* YouTube is almost static at 3.7K.
* Matrix stats are the most interesting to me. Not just because they show greater relative rise, but because Matrix is now the primary comm platform for those who build Decred. Those who care to join Matrix despite all UX pains (which are getting sorted btw) are the ones who look for stronger connection with Decred's contractor collective.

Before Ditto the growth was about the same, sometimes faster. But 2018 was totally different.

Related idea: [Decred Ambassador certification](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/48)

> we want smart — but trusted — devs to come build on Decred.

I would add that ""trusted"" implies devs who share our values.

> We would solicit community input, develop a draft for review, present it to the community (writers channel) via Github, and then collaborate to finalize and approve.

**Questions**

> CNBC, Unconfirmed/Unchained, Bloomberg, TechCrunch, Mashable, and Fortune

Do you think it would be beneficial to prioritize outlets that have discredited themselves less? IIRC CNBC aired a video in which they showed how to [buy XRP](https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/950059747771854853) (at high price?), while I don't remember anything like that from TechCrunch. Or should we just think about what is more effective? What is a good balance with ethics?

Do you have a strategy in case tech giants like Twitter, YouTube or Facebook start to openly or covertly obstruct Decred's message?

Having experienced first hand the quality of work that the Decred team (and community) oversees, I have no doubt that this has potentially to become a widely used exchanged.

In summary, I would be in favor, but it will somewhat depend on the following:



1. **The Benefits to Decred**
In many ways, I feel an exchanged such as this would be a much needed ""Gift"" to the community, whilst the bill will be picked up by existing Decred stake-holders, as well as the time & effort put in by the Core team. As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.


2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**
How confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?


3. **Projected Cost**
The projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?

Thank again for raising this proposal and looking forward to some further clarification.","a11fcdcbc4809c8d8bb9b95ffe3eb6b87b032b3d69d3bc90f032c5dd7535e889904ab8e0fff97edb36295ff4e4a4b9c478319199d596ce8c3b690aaa214b0602","71836a3819239ee5fc24dfd0369e4bb9ea1d0cf3cfc49d5207cb448827b6a2fc","1","0a6688be390fbcc3b2feb326fa726247aad5a7b533c96779a37613c24672998b60a1b4910853bfb540e175a317df5134b22621deda6f5db08ef106b2d31c520d",1549300318,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/1",NA,NA,17,16,9,NA

I do have a few concerns about a Stakeholder funded DEX in general:
 
### -**Relative Cost**
$100,000 to $1,000,000 at current rates is ballpark 6,000 to 60,000 DCR. At the high end, this is approximately 10% of the current DAO treasury holdings, or about 3% of the entire treasury subsidy that will ever exist. [treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx)

### -**DEX Landscape is crowded**
The DEX landscape is crowded. There is the Binance DEX, Blocknet, OpenLedger, IDEX, CryptoBridge, Bisq, Bancor DEX, Kyber, 0x, etc... I know a lot of these are semi-centralized, take a fat commission, require shit-tokens, are still WIP, etc... so don't get on my ass about it. My point is that the landscape is already crowded and is getting more crowded. 

### -**Concerns about lot size order matching**
This one is a bit complicated so bear with me. Essentially to avoid all the shady games that go on with centralized exchanges, the idea is to use lot sizes when matching orders. IE, say I put up 30 DCR for 0.006 BTC each, but someone only wants 20 DCR for 0.006 each, my 30 DCR would need to be subdivided into smaller lots to make the trade happen.

The issue here is twofold: price discovery is limited by the granularity of lot size, and on-chain fees could eat up smaller trades.

**Price Discovery & Granularity**
The resolution of price discovery is limited by both the order size and the minimum lot size. Smaller lot sizes and larger order sizes both increase the resolution of price discovery. IE, for price resolution of +/- 1% of a given exchange rate, you'd need at least one of the assets to have lot sizes of 1/100th of the order being placed (_well, either that, or accept that trades would occur at specific ""harmonics"" where the relative lot sizes of each asset matched the desired exchange rate_). This means that price discovery would degrade at lower value transactions, and leads to my 2nd point:

**On-Chain Fees**
If we do need end up needing transactions to be made up of many small lots to allow price discovery to occur, consider that all transactions will be on-chain. Especially for smaller transactions, this could eat up a significant % of the total transaction value, possibly enough to make the fees or commission on other exchanges seem more attractive in comparison. Especially if we return to conditions where Bitcoin (and possibly Decred) fees are considered expensive.

_TLDR_; I think it's a noble idea but I'm concerned it will be an expensive, low-volume, niche market for high-value transactions.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Curious to see what others think.","5e011eea3df9e82c4b40e8a0dc76ac6a04ebe0172d038b5794e532402f0981019a5e3de7a10b7b6771ef16f5d5f70ca4c797246343eab35668808b5e4aa3e706","561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","3","67bd0767f8816f61dfe6fd83e55f7560925d9d0b13772fac94af1d88e7d6d18a3b4b50f1b212c4ffcb72e50af47c11ed2579040202ddde73e5409ce54bb0470f",1549330338,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/3",NA,NA,20,19,9,NA

---

First off, to put things into perspective, the high-end ask for this proposal is $1M USD.

- At the current DCR/USD exchange rate of $15.75, that is 63,492 DCR. 
- Given the current treasury balance of 605,900 DCR, this expenditure would deplete 10.47% of the treasury.
- Assuming the current treasury block reward of 1.87804688, it would take 33,807 blocks, or 117 days - around 4 months (assuming 5mins/block), to ""pay off"" this amount. This does not take into account the fact that the block reward decreases over time, or the occasional block that doesn't include all 5 ticket votes (cutting that block reward), so the actual time period would be longer.

All these statistics assume that the market price stays the same (which it won't, though I won't speculate which direction it's heading). Given these figures, it's clear that this is a significant outlay of funds, and therefore deserves careful thought and scrutiny.

---

IMHO, the treasury funds should only be spent for two purposes:

- Funding the ongoing maintenance of Decred software, etc. to ensure that DCR does not loose its market value.
- Funding projects that will increase the market value of DCR, rewarding the stakeholders.

Clearly, this proposal does not fit in the former purpose; we shall discuss whether it fits within the latter.

I believe my view on the purpose of the treasury is consistent with sentiments that have been expressed on other proposals, especially [this highly-upvoted comment on the recent Baeond proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14). Quoting an excerpt from there:

> The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).
> 
> The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

An exchange/DEX (however cool it may be), is not directly related to Decred (other than supporting it as an asset). I fail to see how this project will benefit Decred (or have a benefit of sufficient magnitude to justify the cost).

---

The proposal states:

> This improved exchange infrastructure will benefit Decred directly, by making the exchange process more permissionless, thereby increasing its accessibility.

How will this make buying Decred more accessible? Today, I can go to https://changenow.io/ and swap BTC for DCR without creating an account, without KYC/AML (in most cases), and have my DCR within 20 minutes. This is just one example, I am sure there are other instant swap providers with similar offerings.

This exchange promises only to support crypto-to-crypto swaps. Potential DCR buyers already have a far bigger hurdle to overcome, and that is turning fiat into BTC. For many people, that is accomplished via signing up to a centralized exchange, often doing KYC. For some, that exchange is an exchange like https://bittrex.com/ that supports DCR, allowing them to convert USD to DCR (albeit via two trades).

I am aware of the fact that the proposed DEX uses atomic swaps, but I fail to see how removing the requirement of trusting an instant exchange will make Decred so much more accessible that it will increase the price of DCR in a meaningful way (much less compensate the cost of the project).

The proposal further states:

> However, it will also benefit the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem as a piece of common infrastructure, which we can use as a marketing tool.

While I agree that such a DEX will be a marketing tool, again, I question whether its effectiveness there will be enough to defray the cost building it.

The treasury is not a VC firm or grant fund. Just because the DEX is open-source doesn't mean we should just throw grant money at it. The idea itself may be sound, but the Decred treasury isn't the place to fund such an idea IMO.","52c1f11785480904c19d66d9c28b7cfde25498aa5796bfe976dda2b924932e3da5c23c5a2f954a750c5dd27cb621165b65516cc151751865ce692d1a59fdad00","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","4","c11e76ae8b122ce968031b2d61c7b6b75659c74c41f1d55285cdc3a7fad96613f28a363dbea8579f4c78df3757fab6a4c9e213c9184d498e17894a0ef1710f08",1549380623,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/4","ryanzim",NA,16,15,9,NA

> Any protections against fast bots like per-account rate limiting?

I had mentioned in my blog post on the topic, which I will link to in an update to the proposal, that very simple rules could be created to rate-limit trades, e.g. UTXOs used for orders must have not moved for N hours or more to be considered valid.  This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known ""dark"" trading patterns.  

> Any plans to actively engage other chains to integrate?

This process has already begun in our [atomicswap repo on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/), where other projects have added support for doing atomic swaps on their corresponding chains.

> Any plans for protocols that don't leave a trace of swap on the chains?

The first step is always making it work.  Once it is working, obfuscating the swaps on the corresponding chains can happen.  IIRC, there was discussion about using some homomorphic encryption tricks to do just this on BCT.

> Does the TLS mention mean the system involves Certificate Authorities?

I believe the CA system is less than worthless - it is incredibly harmful to communications security.  We use TLS with dcrd, dcrwallet and dcrctl with self-signed certificates for exactly this reason.  The whole CA system exists so that web users can try to avoid knowing anything about security via a list of approved CAs bundled with each browser.","24f50064b87bab373f7fdcf1f0b66bcd40e14672b261b8a9dce01e367453389691b88dfd3238da6d9c2c2bc2d7b58aa35b60ae167d9313e30ffb39f93626cc0a","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","12","ac53cf31fa15553cb9ee3022dabd3ec506956d3b1fc5b94c283a8b9420277766638e0388252a3a03915640f5d7b0d6402c2a989615b868a5333159330c463803",1549472468,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/12","jy-p",NA,14,14,8,NA

First, I consider ryanzim to provide generally good constructive criticism, which I will address below.  Second, ryanzim is a developer for the Exodus wallet, which, as far as I am aware, collects fees on exchanges performed in their wallet and is their project's primary source of income.  This presents, IMO, a pretty clear conflict-of-interest regarding the view he has shared on the proposal.

I agree that the upper end cost cited for the work is high at USD 1M, and it was not intended to indicate that would be _likely_ cost of the work, merely that we should not entertain proposals to build it for any amount greater than that.

Regarding the relevance of the proposal, I would argue that it is very much relevant to Decred.  Several notable DCR holders have brought up that they consider our lack of liquidity to be a problem that needs fixing.  The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  One of the reasons that MMs cost so much is that they are typically experienced proprietary traders who have to deal with the risks and stresses of a wide variety of bots being run against them.  If the MM gets cleaned out by someone else's bots, they have no reason to continue making the market and will quit.  If we build a system that uses pseudorandom order matching, this substantially reduces the threat of being gamed by others' bots, which lowers the risks and stresses associated with being a MM.  Lowering the barriers to being a MM will lead to a deeper order book and help decentralize our liquidity, versus paying one or a few MMs to perform this task for us.

Comparing a custodial ""instant"" exchange to a DEX that uses atomic swaps is comparing apples and oranges.  ChangeNOW is certainly an interesting service, but it is permissioned - per their FAQ ""ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.""  Note that instant exchanges do nothing to solve the problem of order book depth that we have, which creates slippage for people entering and exiting DCR positions.

I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like.  If we take a moment to look at the big picture with cryptocurrencies, it goes something like this:

* The irresponsible behavior of banks cued SN to create/release Bitcoin, which decentralized value storage and transmission via gamification of the timestamping process.
* The central planning committee of Bitcoin Core / Blockstream cued me to work with tacotime and _ingsoc to create and release Decred, which decentralized sovereignty via gamification of the decision-making process.

My motivation to create Decred was based on experiencing the bullshit of Bitcoin's central planning committee firsthand, and I had the luxury of tacotime having proposed a system that could address precisely this problem concurrent with my experiences.  After 3 years of building out Decred, it has become clear to me that a major hurdle for the project is that of market liquidity.  This proposal is a reflection of my seeing this centralization and gatekeeping of liquidity as being the next major problem for a cryptocurrency-based ecosystem to resolve, i.e.

* The centralization of liquidity within the CC ecosystem cued me to propose decentralized exchange via ""ungamification"" of the trading process.","4fd94edecbf973ea3f2779d8d770075894c8c18b88bc6fbb73c0a5db3d33f65fdecfbca0a7595afc39dae47bad6026c46c57ab5eaedbe36699b5867bed15c405","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","15","fdea538af785ae79c8afd33ed0d957013e892d8d1d9c0eae782267e474546aaf34c02a8acf3dee9f0d79a8af718ccfc6fce809be095959a43dd475848d28620e",1549477522,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/15","jy-p",NA,19,17,10,NA

The DEX landscape is indeed crowded.  I am of the view that most of these projects have the wrong incentive structure, i.e. collecting fees on trades, which is a pretty fundamental difference between what is being proposed here and what already exists.  When you're collecting fees on trades, you're incentivized to generate volume, not order book depth, which is what I believe we all really want.

Your issues with lot sizes are valid, but the reality of working with on-chain transactions as the basis for unfalsifiable orders acts as a strong constraint on what we can do.  The partial fill problem is tricky.  I would expect there to be several lot sizes being traded concurrently in a healthy DEX-based market, which would mean there would be several pairs traded, each at a pair of chosen lot sizes.  In more detail, we could have DCR/BTC markets that have (DCR 10, BTC 0.01), (DCR 1, BTC 0.001), and (DCR 0.1, BTC 0.0001) lot sizes, where episodic arbitrage occurs between them.

Once fee pressure becomes an issue with the lot sizes, I would expect some of the exchange to move off-chain and occur over LN, per my blog entry comments.","ab612b1ebaf427e743368faa386a6515f9c290ce100d068e384da9a0ddc5729687622f2cf277ced0f1791bc14b3364cadb83b8003f6523f69aa6bb74477c8b0e","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","16","6b409fc70af042857ae7f5da1813286ae5066bfd47f4ea3799bf5816daad9f32f564c00a95e683b7e34c87316d8313fa05965911cb90cbf37d4a970bae693b0b",1549478594,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/16","jy-p",NA,11,11,8,NA

This is correct.

I am aware of the potential conflict-of-interest here. Personally, I have serious reservations about the architecture of the exchange itself (fee structure, etc.), but I have refrained from discussing them here since there is almost no way I can discuss them without potential conflict-of-interest. Instead, I have solely focused on the issue of whether the Decred treasury should pay for the DEX, since I feel there is less potential for conflict-of-interest there.

Also, for the record, all my opinions here are my own personal opinions, not those of my employer, and I am receiving no compensation for expressing my opinions here. Hopefully that goes without saying, but I thought I'd make it explicitly clear.

Understood, thanks for clarifying. Regardless, I believe my point still stands that this is a significant outlay of funds, and needs careful consideration.

Regarding your two paragraphs about liquidity/MMs/instant exchanges:

It seems I somewhat misunderstood your main intention behind the exchange; I was arguing under the assumption that by ""increasing accessibility"", you meant ""making it easier for new people (either noobs to crypto, or people already in crypto, but new to DCR) to buy their first DCR"". Reading your reply here, it seems I've misunderstood.

If I'm understanding you correctly, your primary motivation for building the exchange is:

1. There isn't enough Decred liquidity
1. You don't want to pay a MM to increase liquidity
1. Instead, you want to build a DEX that will want to make people be MMs for DCR without direct pay
1. You believe this will also have a side effect of decentralizing market-making
1.  ChangeNOW does nothing to solve your primary gripe with the current situation: liquidity

Please correct me if I've misunderstood you yet again.

> I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like

VC-like probably isn't the right term to use. I don't mean that your exchange proposal is some ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme; I don't mean that the proposal fundamentally misunderstands what crypto is all about, like too many VC firms do; etc.

Let me try to clarify my position on what I feel should and should not receive treasury funding. Examples are probably best to illustrate my point.

Things the treasury is for funding:

- Maintaining Decred software
- Building a mobile wallet for Decred
- Building Politeia
- Building a DAE to manage the treasury funds
- Building libraries to make it easier for other products to implement Decred
- Funding marketing for Decred

Things the treasury could possibly fund (debatable):

- Integration into an existing ATM network
- Integration fees for a hardware wallet

Things out of scope for treasury funding (in my OP, I incorrectly used the term VC-like to refer to these kinds of things):

- Building an all-new hardware wallet
- Building a new crypto ATM machine that supports Decred
- Building an exchange (centralized or decentralized)

In short, this exchange may or may not become popular. If it becomes popular, it may or may not help Decred liquidity (i.e. maybe it'll just be the most popular way to exchange BTC/LTC). We have no way of knowing for sure.

I fail to see how building a better exchange is any more deserving of funding from the treasury, than building a better hardware wallet or ATM machine. Does the world need better hardware wallets, ATM machines, or exchanges? Maybe, maybe not; but I don't believe the treasury needs to fund any of these projects.","af38dc951b3e0c187d4086b2e2cce91a48465cd6fd4871d31bc5bd182cf5092590c6524fa5872c8dd2a87d0737e717c61baaa350831498c1371954956d6d5904","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","18","9238d82c525e918921fec0752d0b33707e77e630d20c79c2de5aed2682cf76698d39874fee69a6a5d5849a97d589242dae925168cbbed6ac8f24c4fdf501c905",1549481752,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/18","ryanzim",NA,12,11,9,NA

It would be inappropriate to spend this amount of treasury funds on a low project priority DEX.  What if the price of Decred continues to drop?

This would allow voters to vote Yes on each proposal they deemed suitable, without the prospect of accidentally approving more than one.

As discussed on Slack, I think there are a lot of good ideas in the implementation details and a lot of the issues raised are well founded and researched. My objection is on a few fronts simultaneously, although none of them relate to the technical implementation details - not because I don't have reservations, but because the other objections supersede them anyway. So, in no particular order:

1. There is little guarantee that the exchange will gain traction and aid Decred in any meaningful way.  
   1. Numerous similar projects with great teams have tried and failed to gain liquidity (even centralised exchanges with large budgets).  
   2. I'm unsure if a DEX is what the vast majority of people that will bring liquidity want; most people I know, whilst they grumble at KYC, are quite happy with Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, etc.  
   3. It is possible that even if the DEX attracted liquidity for some crosses (such as ETH/BTC, or BCH/BTC), it still might not attract liquidity for DCR.
2. This would benefit all cryptocurrencies listed on the DEX so the cost to develop should be split, not fully funded by Decred.
3. One of the justifications for this proposal is that it will increase liquidity, but as objection #1 states it's quite a risky bet. There is a much more measurable method to increase liquidity (and thus indirectly increase market cap): designated market making (DMM) (https://sci-hub.tw/10.1017/S0022109000004166). Of course I am biased, but I don't agree with the objections given to using a DMM (and the empirical evidence backs me up):
> The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  

$30,000 seems a lot at first, but when you realise that empirically DMM's add 5+% to your market cap, that means it'd be worth about $7m to Decred as a whole and ~$12.5k/month of additional funds to the treasury alone. For further info on valuing liquidity and market makers, the introduction of this paper provides a good meta analysis of the research already available: https://sci-hub.tw/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2154699. I further argue the price manipulation standpoint. Using a DMM increases market depth and would actually make DCR less susceptible to market manipulation. That said, there are a lot of valid concerns regarding choosing a DMM which you have raised on Slack. There are many unscrupulous crypto DMMs out there (even some very well known ones). You have to really know what you're doing when it comes to the contract negotiation (namely, spread guarantees, uptime, and sizes shown at various levels).","82f197a914dd8bab17c341ea8a6e5d2de2d53efc04b0e63163c15163f663281b8f5c28cce729a1e8a48919f85ffdee2b0f5027720d78b3863316e173130ca005","58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556","24","95c05c8dcf47b28908824ce6296c88b0c24539f3e54d21d9ac472d2ec265f71b9607fd7ec34a5fead0d6aed0db34c6083171a1931ea5fab9044dabf269167200",1549563033,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/24",NA,NA,24,15,17,NA

- Socializing the merits of Decred as a SOV to venture, institutional, and other investor groups.  And courting asset management intermediaries that are building solutions to cater to institutional investors

- Expanding the number of exchanges that list DCR, and explore ways to work with exchanges to identify sustainable ways to increase DCR liquidity 

- Actively engaging Merchants to accept DCR as a medium of exchange, and building solutions to make the mobile exchange of dcr much easier

IMO this is a complicated matter because the points you present are valid. However they remain valid only when the objective is to maintain and foster the current ecosystem, with the same actors and incentives. 

Personally, I can't stand KYC, trading fees, and trusting tiers. I have years of bad experiences with exchanges, banks,  financial and/or CC services who are built with the only goal of artificially extracting more money from you.

The reason I got in cryptocurrencies is because I want out of this. I see every effort made to re-create the same structures and incentives as ways to hold back evolution and change.

At some point we will need a real DEX if we have any hope of changing these structures. And not the closed source, intermediary token, fee grabbing attempts we see now.

For me a real DEX would not be operated by a single party, would not require a single wallet and would be open source and possible to integrate freely in any wallet or app for any CC without requiring a central entity or fees and there would be no actors for regulators to potentially mess with and hinder functionality in the future. Unfortunately I have absolutely no confidence in any of the existing ""DEX"" projects out there to achieve this...


On the question of whether the Decred stakeholders should use the treasury to fund this project, we'll see how the vote turns out. The things I'm considering now are :

- We are in a unique position in this space that we have the ability to build a ""real"" DEX. If we don't, who & when does someone will?
- For how long can we go without a real DEX before it become a real issue for innovation? Or do we just accept past and current structures as inevitable?
- There's risk in using a sizeable part of our treasury.
- We are in a bear market and the effective cost would be higher now.
- In a bull market it would be cheaper but don't we wish there was a ""real"" DEX when the time comes.


This one really isn't easy for stakeholders. ;)

- A fair price discovery (making sure everybody receives fair prices and is not screwed, even if one is not a trader) requires high liquidity. With this proposal I see a very fragmented marketplace landscape - each server with its own order book and low volume. Do I understand correctly, that the servers do not share orders to build one huge liquid market? 
- Servers might not be able to operate in a sustainable way with one-time account fees? This is especially bad, if my previous point is correct. Because, then the best market servers with high liquidity (probably many users) would have the biggest issues to finance opeartion long-term.","9d03ba3b2283639e954161dbec2df1285880c8744b8c08d780d234ad41f6cb426e619275f4095513686cf68b1fe481516a31fb42dacf11c487ac1859814c750b","04eef072313a74989d19e1253709ca10ddb706b9210634da31c6c39aa92ed94c","33","4be18ff7cd0c4efd181fb110610315b71728f3db212da61c8fa91bb765d01030178570754a965187913773692fc11bc88f7ed3b360f1a461a09918050d2ca20b",1549720889,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/33",NA,NA,16,15,9,NA

Re point 1. How will this benefit Decred ? 

This is a great technological demonstration for Decred. I feel somewhere that the fact that Decred did the majority of the ground work for atomic swaps has been lost to common crypto folks.

1. **Exchange via atomic swaps appeals only to a very particular demographic of traders — institutional block trading**. Why is a retail trader or proprietary trading firm going to use the DEX?

2. This DEX would essentially be a market data network — ****How is each node going to share market data from server to server at scale and globally?** How are prices going to be in sync in a distributed system across many time zones without one centralized server?
**
3. No high-frequency trading will be possible via atomic swaps — **High frequency trading provides the vast majority of liquidity in traditional markets - where is liquidity going to come from on the DEX?**

4. Understood that we want to disintermediate centralized exchanges and create a trading utopia without trading fees, but **we are forgetting that exchange fees have value because exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc) can use those fees to offer new services to appeal to more demographics of traders. Hence, at the very least, it is important for the DEX to be revenue producing for the Decred network fund**. The DEX could charge a very small fee that atomic-swaps into DCR and that fee auto-sends back into the network fund.

5) Lastly, **the DEX project is very expensive and DCR is on it's lows** — better to table it for now and sleep on it some more -- maybe bring it up again later when the network fund is in better shape. There are many other aspects of the Decred network to work on in the meantime 👍

Plus, many don't use DEX's currently and would rather wait until another DEX is accepted by the masses and use some funds to get listed there.  Or if no other DEX proves to be worthy in a year or 2 when the market recovers, we proceed with this plan then.

I'll preface my comments with the following note; people tend to conflate the idea of the DEX with ""market making"" (which in crypto takes place in a very different manner than in traditional markets whereby liquidity providers usually make use of their own inventory), suggesting that all initiatives to increase liquidity are similar or that only one approach can be put into play.  I am personally a proponent of a multifaceted strategy, MM/DEX are not mutually exclusive and I would like to elucidate why a DEX will bring a degree of resilience to the Decred market that can not be replicated even by increasing the volume of DCR traded by one or more orders of magnitude on traditional exchanges.

Having DCR trade on a decentralized exchange which eliminates counterparty risk from the equation will bring a different type of liquidity and depth to the market that I believe very few coins actually have. A healthy order book will have tons of bids, many of them being ""lowballs"" (bidding for DCR at a price that is significantly below the last print). All that might seem useless but it is actually very beneficial and shows confidence in the asset.

Now say a user wants to bid for $1M USD of DCR (in BTC terms) at $5 (which is a steep discount to that last trade of $17), what that entails on a traditional exchange is exposing that $1M USD of BTC to counterparty risk, as the exchange can go under, be hacked, flag your account for ""suspicious activity"" and deny you access to your funds. In short, there are a myriad of ways which you can be screwed, even with the best centralized exchanges, making the most conservative way to use them  look like:

1. Send a small chunk of BTC to the exchange
2. Trade BTC for DCR
3. Withdraw DCR
4. GOTO 1

So you in essence only remove liquidity from the exchange and there is little incentive to be a price maker as the time your funds are exposed to the counterparty increases your risk profile. The strategy outlined above requires you to break up your trade to manage the risk, then rinse and repeat until you have acquired the size you desire. There is no reason to place bids or asks that are not anticipated to be filled in the immediate future. You are also likely to be required to go through the KYC/AML dance as there are very few exchanges that will allow users to transact without first being vetted.

Now putting on my investor hat for a moment another issue comes to the fore; having the ability to exit a position is even more important than the process by which you acquire it. Any investor worth their salt will want to be able to get an idea of what their position is actually worth. E.g., if you wake up at 3 AM and decide to sell, how much slippage will there be and can the market absorb your size? This is where the order book starts to become important. Even in the case of coins that do very healthy amounts of volume, it is quite evident that a great deal of the bids or asks can disappear at a moments notice when they appear at risk of getting a fill. In essence, many orders on centralized exchanges are placed by bots with no intention of ever following through with a trade, they exist solely to create the illusion of liquidity and trick the user into a false sense of security. These same types of bots are in many instances also able to take advantage of unsophisticated traders that place market orders, by frontrunning them (essentially acting as scalpers), but I will not get into that issue as this post has already become overly verbose.

So to put it succinctly, what a DEX buys us is a place where the actual health of the Decred market can be gauged. I have no illusions about massive amounts of volume materializing on day one, however I think having the infrastructure to disintermediate the centralized exchanges will put the project in a unique position to entice players that would traditionally not be adding liquidity to throw their hat in the ring, as the risks of participating in the market are significantly diminished.","0f140e75af29407d3c63df0269d212a8e23e6c497c54f2a252a8e7692bd3e868cf42a1be38ea44eceb9ebe63a8328a94ca879100ab5ba3e4f22e43366a3c0809","db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","47","b8f6db5b930f953d46615ba09a600012c4f1996c0ae31e8b0896161a613afd3dbf17185b126066f6fcf05f72ddb9a88054954f88ab449375ff7f471846b33c02",1550462264,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/47","jz_bz",NA,21,21,8,NA

Correct. First step is to have basic client-server working, and later to connect servers in a mesh with shared order book.

> Multiple times some ""large holders"" were referenced who are interested in this DEX. It would help a lot if couple entities step up and reveal their passion (or even commitment) to use this DEX, e.g. Iterative, Placeholder, etc. If we only knew more about ""Yocom-Piatt confirmed that a number of large DCR stakeholders have expressed interest in a product that prevents such slippage."" (source)

I am not going to comment further regarding who has expressed interest in using the DEX extensively since it would be a violation of their privacy, IMO.

> How reusable this DEX tech will be for LN-based atomic swap trading?

Since LN is very low latency, I expect that the order matching algorithm might need to change.  The format of limit orders would have to change as well because they would not be backed by UTXOs, but rather funds stored in LN channels.  These are non-trivial changes, but much of the overall architecture could remain the same.

> Why do you think it makes sense to start DEX sooner rather than wait e.g. a year?

It will take a while to get the MVP ready, it will take several weeks or months to get some decent liquidity going, etc.  The sooner we start this process, the sooner there can be real progress made on the liquidity front.

> Is it possible/feasible to adjust the pace of work to market conditions? e.g. when market is bad slow down and spend less?

Yes, there is no reason this needs to be completed as fast as possible.

> Is it possible to prepare an ability to pause the project after certain key deliverables (""checkpoints"")?

I don't think committing to this is a good idea unless there is another serious dip in the exchange rate.

> What aspects of the proposal facilitate integration with existing trading actors? I assume open protocols, but perhaps some tools can be built to specifically ease integration job.

MMs can show up, setup shop, and the project and they do  not have to worry about counterparty risk at the exchange.

> How about time-locking orders so that they cannot be quickly removed? This could stop even more games and make the order book even more ""real"".

Making the matching process difficult to game, i.e. fairer, strikes me as fixing the most glaring problem with markets.  Overuse of cancellations of limit orders is obviously not a good thing, but I think time-locks would create on-chain bloat and go too far in terms of tieing traders' hands.

> There were concerns that DEX work will slow down other developments, and the rebuttal was something like ""the DEX won't have any impact on c0 roadmap"". Is it certain that c0 will not be building the DEX? Also, even if not directly developing the DEX I expect some review and coordination effort will happen to work with the DEX contractor - any estimate on that?

After some internal discussion, C0 could generate the engineering specifications without too much effort, but I am not interested in having us write the DEX client and server.  I would very much like to have a non-C0 contractor or group of contractors perform that work.

> Does the budget include marketing/PR expenses to promote the DEX, or will this be covered by Decred's PR budget?

To date, we've kept our marketing expenses pretty limited, with an eye to reaching audiences at trade shows and via trade publications and other media.  I would not expect it to be necessary to budget for marketing exclusively for the DEX.  Provided it has decent liquidity, it could be the subject of some articles in trade publications and other media, which doesn't create a large incremental marketing/PR cost.","10239d81c44bdd62015979dd564bc03f78344acbc9ed9ca23ebae85f27db0734febe00508955571fb8d916325418957464cb1bab88fe92fceb1173abe9e1b40f","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","61","73f736b3fb29eb47098560eeb362a2fc29878dcb588c733db7b21cf8acd8c77b82bedf32948242493f32c52d473bfae3a8e678df2fcfaef0527dc70d9a95c40f",1550632886,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/61","jy-p",NA,12,12,8,NA

Apart from that, I think its a good alternative to OTC trading which restricts my liquidity pool to

- Trusted parties

- Atomic swappers available via out of band communication, which is not private in sense of identity and transaction linking.

- Third party escrows and untrusted people, which increases the risk a lot.

I think this a very elegant solution that brings more privacy to atomic swaps by eliminating need for out of band communication and combines the liquidity of all willing parties via a single yet decentralized interface. To me this is strict improvement over current OTC trading.

As for competing with other DEXes or ""Why this DEX?"" question, i think it brings some unique properties to distinguish itself, as described in the proposal.

I am happy to see the reduced expenditure and MVP approach. Its good to build this in steps while taking feedback at every step.

Re: Expenditure Concerns - I think $250K is very reasonable for a lasting piece of infrastructure, especially in the light of other yearly budget proposals.

Re: Sharing of expense: I don't think its possible for us to force this other than by gating the listing with a fee, which is counter to the spirit/aim of this proposal.

What I was asking is whether server operator has the power to cancel a selected order during normal operation, kind of order censorship.

I think the answer is yes he can, as there's nothing directly preventing that. The orders are not stored on-chain. On-chain action begins only when orders are matched, and _then_ the server cannot stop the swap.

But indirectly the server operator risks its reputation because the order was accepted, signed by the server and broadcast to other clients. If multiple clients observe a missing order without observing a proper cancel order, it would be a clear sign that the server censored something.

If I got it all right, man this is huge.

The interface will be centralized, at least until the server mesh is in place. The swaps will be decentralized.

What I like about it is the same pragmatism so common in Decred. Fully decentralized tech is very challenging, complex and expensive.

Take Politeia for example. If the developers fanatically pursued full decentralization, we wouldn't be talking here right now. Instead they chose to get going with centrally controlled server _instance_. But the code, protocols and most _data_ is open, and the service is non-custodial, so overall it is _pretty_ decentralized.

Same for this DEX: server instances will be centrally controlled, but code, protocols and data will be open, and the service will be non-custodial.

Great idea! We shouldn't be too annoying with this, but we should definitely let people know that they can help by sharing the cost (as well as contributing dev/testing/liquidity/etc).

Here's the thing. I was totally on your page of thinking until something happened with my own little /r/bitcoinca community. 

The biggest exchange in Canada blew up. Leaving over 100K customers wanting for over 100 million dollars in crypto and fiat.

This was an echo of MTGox, BTC-E, Bitfinex, Cryptopia and will happen again, and again, and again, and again. until one day, someone cracks the decentralized exchange nut.

Decred deserves a crack at that nut, for no other reason than that [Dave is behind the proposal](https://blocktv.com/watch/2019-02-20/5c6d6a2be03e3-chain-breakers-promoting-constant-disruption-), and it's a nut worth cracking. 

> [In terms of Decred, our goal is to build something that has longevity and lasts. We have a subsidy so that we do not have to run out of funding. We were not ICO`d, we have no funds up front. So everything is built to last.

I think it would be very helpful for us to start thinking in terms of centuries when it comes to Decred. And part of that includes building infrastructure that could be used to exchange crypto to crypto, or even crypto to fiat derivatives if all exchange websites were banned by governments around the world at the same time. 

And I'm not saying this goal is going to be easy. And to take a quote from Kenndy:
> We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon...We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.

In all likelihood the first implementation will be over budget, behind schedule, buggy, and blow up on the platform. The UI will suck, the user experience, terrible. But it doesn't matter! The ground work will be there for generations to come.

This purpose of this project is to understand and track the activity on Politeia. A better understanding of how the proposals site is being used will inform the interpretation of its outputs and decisions about how Pi is developed.

#### Products

- Processed data from Politeia, and code to do the processing, available to all in accessible forms
- Reproducible analyses, statistics and charts
- Write-ups that offer interpretation of the data

This [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research) has been created to organize and track the work and its readme has a more complete description of what this will involve, plus some ideas for analysis and early work on a few aspects.

The purpose of this project is to understand how social media coverage of cryptocurrencies works, and how Decred is performing relative to its peers. 

Platforms like reddit and twitter seem to be quite influential in the cryptocurrency space, but it can be difficult to understand how they work in practice. 

This project would be about collecting data from a set of platforms and using it to address questions of interest.

Platforms:

- Reddit - data from reddit is easy to access, I have already [started](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/reddit1.md) to [explore](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/readme.md) what kind of analysis is useful.
- Twitter - data is harder to access and collect. I would be interested in seeing network analysis of who follows/likes/re-tweets who, and what the components of the network look like.
- GitHub - not exactly social media but has some of the same features and is quite amenable to detailed analysis. @degeri is already [working on](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) a way to identify first-time Decred contributors automatically through GitHub for the Journal.

The purpose would be addressing questions like:

- How do different projects use the same platform? What kind of value do they gain from the platform? Is there anything Decred can learn from their approach?
- Is it possible to identify attempts at manipulating or gaming the platform? 

I have created a [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/) with exploratory work on reddit, it would probably make sense to start new repositories for research on other platforms.","09b889982f4cbf826f89e68f0d761c6a8004ba1cfe57491690656e5de295b0b42307321faadd0dcebf343ba105089913b3fe4279a92e7f5c0c73960a93937d03","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","2","378f778b75c96a64089b72331313242e25dd156a1f7680abb1dd017143fcb8e5abe49590410f182ef9906af4980ae7d97e12d7728d8cc98a6974b45fb2f53d0f",1543271615,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/2","richard-red",NA,18,16,10,NA

Specifically with regard to **governance**, if this is truly decentralized and permissionless we should be able to identify open public spaces and fora for each project where deliberation is occurring and decisions are being made. Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.

In my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!

Decred's approach is excellent in this regard:

- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals
- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.
- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space

Any project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.

For projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where ""the team"" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. 

I have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.

I see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).","0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","3","ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106",1543272531,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/3","richard-red",NA,11,11,8,NA

Depending on the tools Ditto uses to monitor social media, and their licensing, Ditto may not be permitted to share data and insights from those tools publicly with the Decred community. We'll start finding out more about how the Ditto relationship works from next week.

Visions and potentials for how dcrtime and Politeia have been shared.  Examples include [Jake at MIT](https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/jake-yocom-piatt-decred-blockchain-sovereignty/) giving a straight forward presentation, the fascinating ideas during the [Politeia Challenge](https://medium.com/@slgoss04/decreds-politeia-challenge-took-place-february-10th-at-the-hyatt-regency-in-austin-texas-482986b75a18) and even the classic [Politeia Use Cases EP4 of Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQYmLx0eTg) which aired over a year ago now.

We are using Politeia and dcrtime and it works great.  The success should be viewed like the Mars landing.  This is a very big deal and frankly other projects are missing out by not utilizing these tools and the practically free blockchain anchoring and pre-built authorization abilities in Politeia.

A lot of other things are also going right.  A quick search of what good [readme files](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) should look like on open source projects or a deep dive into the code in the [politeia code](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui) illustrates we have solid repositories and excellent code commenting.

Is the extended community interested in looking at how to better support the development team that has built these tools in advocating for their usage?  If so, are we interested in researching some basic questions?  Here are a few examples that could be looked at:

1. What are projects today doing as best practice to attract usage?
2. What do business integration companies working with other products today want that has not been built out (specifications? documentation? technical briefs? media/materials?)?

Crytpocurrency news outlets frequently report on merchants who have recently started to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payment for their goods/services in countries such as Venezuela (1) and it appears as though this is one of the most compelling use cases for cryptocurrencies to facilitate payments.

Decred is likely to be well suited as an exchange medium or form of payment for goods and services given its transaction fees, mobile wallet support and transaction times. 

The aim of this research is to investigate the following:
(i) how, why and in what way are cryptocurrencies currently used in countries such as Venezuela (or others with an unstable fiat currency)
(ii) is there an opportunity for Decred usage to increase in any such countries?
(iii) If so, what does Decred need in order to increase its usage?

Suggested lines of inquiry:
- What is the prevelance of cryptocurrency as a payment method in countries with unstable currencies and macroeconomic indicators
- In which sectors/industries are merchants most likely to accept cryptocurrency for payment
- What are the most popular ways in which consumers acquire cryptocurrency?
- What are the most popular services merchants use to accept crypto?
- For how long do they hold crypto before converting to fiat and which fiat currencies do they tend to convert into?

The example questions are interesting, but without proposed methodologies it is difficult to evaluate whether they are the best questions to ask.

Collect and evaluate coverage of Decred in ""the media"". This research can inform us about how Decred performs in the press and whether we should adjust our outreach/marketing efforts. This is different from _social media research_ proposed in another comment.

A prototype of a building block for this already exists: [decred-media-tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) -- a collaboratively maintained dataset of links to Decred coverage along with some metadata. Some examples of what it makes possible:

* statistics
  * how many pieces of content are generated per week/month
  * which domains and authors post more or less about Decred
  * stats for countries and languages
* deeper analysis from following the links (some can be automated):
  * assess quality of content, including factual errors
  * categorize the subject of the article
  * analyze the keywords/SEO
  * use techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling
* independent researchers can build on top of it

Before seriously engaging with the media tracker [several issues](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker/issues) need to be figured out, and discussion with Ditto is desirable to learn their ways of measuring media performance.","e363c8a0482b5356b1893134241407abab194a10e2b426c02216aff0d33e270e0449758c2d0035aa8168f19bde0735d8c8536e2bc870ac969e46d401e439630a","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","13","5ea0edeff7f2cd974f65d644de9c7d33abf0ffc4324cda2594e341c1ab42a7dc57004248b5028ff6df1316e8e7bf3b3d825d0f568fa80d4323c9a355d2513108",1543526446,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/13","bee",NA,14,14,8,NA

Study and watch governance models outside Decred. Analyze and report successes, failures and any interesting events. Contrast other models with Decred. The goal is to learn from external experience and borrow good ideas.

Both on-chain (formal, consensus layer) and off-chain (informal, social level) processes are considered.

This may overlap with _cryptocurrency social media_ research outlined in another comment because some processes occur on platforms like Reddit, Twitter or GitHub.

Potential projects: Aragon, Navcoin (community fund), DemocracyEarth, Tezos, EOS, Ethereum, Cardano, Dash, Horizen (ZenCash), Zcash, Dfinity.

In my view one of the most important aspects is clearly identifying the public spaces where governance discussions and decision-making take place. I don't think it is possible to assess how well a project is governed without observing that governance in action.

- Reddit
- GitHub
- IRC
- Forums
- Slack
- Matrix
- Discord
- Telegram
- Custom (e.g. Politeia)

I'm not sure how viable this idea is but it strikes me that Decred is unique in that it has a POS layer in which funds are functionally ""locked up"" in exchange for a voting right. If the locked up funds could be 'used' somehow to provide additional 'features' such as privacy in addition to securing the right to vote, a win-win situation could be achieved.

The research question is thus: Is it possible to increase the role of staked funds such that ""locked"" funds can increase the privacy of Decred (e.g using a 'coin join' technique or something else novel).","4369911c9e910f6700afd7968f3721b93515d5faa9f5e2d025177c2092e25ae5cf470ab487d14ffb474506558a423ea0c23d867fd744aa735754af84f30d8e07","5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","19","ea82eab85cdfeabc208d7a2757896f0c27588eba14f7f1c2c81714b37f06abd659d418684f5db826d4072ca54a156c53e11913f281d762059ef689b187dc8106",1543550940,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/19",NA,NA,11,8,11,NA

1. Deleterious to network effects of nascent currencies wrt Metcalfe or (much better IMO) transactome-informed network capital theory (see Gogerty's work) 
2. A/B testing of different technical, economic or philosophical approaches (""let the market decide"")
3. An inevitability of entropy and/or finite social scalability as these networks grow and mature it is difficult to keep all stakeholders sufficiently aligned for optimal network health.

As such, protocol-layer fork resistance and effective public fora with voting mechanisms can certainly be helpful tools, but I suppose there is a question as to whether the so-called tyranny of the majority should be exercised in all cases. If there was a ""block size"" style civil war in Decred with no acceptable compromise in sight, is the status quo still the best situation in all cases?

Disclaimer: I have an ongoing research project studying forks from a variety of perspectives and Decred's fork-resistance got a nod in the manuscript. Going to revisit it again soon. So I am biased :)

It is a rather nuanced topic but I will hopefully be able to precis it here.

As part of my investigations on the above topic [http://asymmetries.pllel.com], I have been involved as a ""Pollinator"" in the DAO Stack Alchemy Genesis AlphaDAO - their semi-centralised testing bed. As part of this some erstwhile collaborators who are ""DAO & Governance"" specialists are part of a unit funded by the GenesisDAO named the ""Accountability Task Force (ATF). See us on a panel at the Web3 Summit Hackerspace here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipPErp0UM0]

As this DAO is funded by, allocates funds to successful proposals AND pays them natively in ETH with no indexing or mitigation for cryptoasset price voltatility. This is obviously in contrast to what happens in Decred, with DCR being the payment method via treasury but with nominal cashflows being indexed to USD value.

Due to the rather pronounced decline in the fiat price of cryptoassets recently, the latest and supposedly final proposal to continue funding the ATF for 2 more months at a cost of 50 ETH has created a huge amount of contention and debate. People asking for it to be rescinded (mainnet on-chain so not possible), others downvoting including head of DAOStack Matan Field, others asking for more accountability on funding spend, yet others asking for refund. IMO many people still have last winter's prices in their heads. Personally, I voted for it, to see the resolution of the experiment, and because I don't consider ETH to be a monetary asset or have a long-term value proposition.

What is really fascinating is that part of the ATF's remit is to map out social attack vectors in DAOs, and people started to ask if this was a simulated attack :) They said no, and I genuinely believe it not to be, but who can say. 

It somewhat leads to the notion that DAOs and ""human governance"" are at odds with each other. I also had a front-row seat for that other DAO (TheDAO) having been a token holder. I am super interested to see how things work out here and have been passing on tips to the GenesisDAO reflecting some of the best practises I see in Decred - for example suggesting pricing / payout of proposals in DAI rather than ETH.

Anyway, hope that is of interest, another case study on the gigantic pile of messed up cryptocurrency governance happenings, within which Decred appears to be the smoothest sailing ship on the seas...","de05329551d78e10f19dad9fe6ea1b8e73f0d0140e597048018960538e8d78024b54725721fb16da3f189aa5258ed94df2fcfed9dbe2d686d781818c5a04fe07","e4bd7728afb70aef87b6d4a01fa9e4102748d71cab69dd32f29ede71567e05c4","33","63e01a18f4951aefdab443f42deb5fcb90da4736dc80351719643ab347012870490f234bf6cded1777b9a34aeedc265eb821dd423b880279ff63c57925ddc704",1544282218,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/33",NA,0,0,0,0,0

There is some merit in the idea that exchanges should pay money to cryptocurrencies they list (including Decred). Not because of who of them is more popular, but due to the fundamental fact that cryptocurrencies come first, exchanges come second.

Coins can exist without exchanges, but exchanges cannot exist without coins. Cryptocurrencies are more complex, require more skill to maintain, have much higher cost of programming mistake (whole network compromised vs one exchange compromised), while exchanges get hacked and lose money much more often. Cryptos embody the spirit of freedom and privacy while exchanges are primarily focused on making money, which forces them to obey sanctions and relentlessly KYC clients. The idea to eliminate trading fees by [Decred DEX](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) is such a bold move.

Note that I'm not saying that exchanges don't bring any value to the ecosystem, they bring a lot. I'm just saying that fundamentally they are secondary to cryptocurrencies. Also note that I only mean serious cryptocurrencies, which excludes some 95% of the market.","08342abfe847188810567ddd9d24d33debcca94862d6042350c42d7c7f3e82cfe015f9b13441752156de52a63dcc38d38893170a29919346c9b75cfcc0dee90c","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","30","6e69ec2fb6089db25ad88d1d94be412993e76a3990eff937734724faf44ab4954d26d2df1dcf8ae05aa540967ec098e2d6d501cd8034e60bd015f80e0b18570d",1551519097,0,0,FALSE,NA,"60adb9c0946482492889e85e9bce05c309665b3438dd85cb1a837df31fbf57fb/comments/30","bee",NA,10,10,8,NA

It cannot be stressed enough how accurate unbiased information is critical to make good decisions. Decred's vision is that a collective of people with skin in the game can make good decisions even in areas they are not experts. In my view this vision naturally demands to have our own, self-funded, strong research department. And we are lucky to have people interested in it because it yields best results.

Early proposal charts showed us what we could not see from the numbers. Data visualization is useful in general because it allows us to utilize the well developed ""graphical"" part of our brain to quickly process information. Besides deeper insight, pretty [infographics](https://github.com/decredcommunity/issues/issues/15) are good marketing material. I hope to see more data vis. Perhaps there can be a collaboration with design group that would create pretty images from the data generated by the research group.

I'm not sure if Politeia Digest and contributions to Decred Journal were/are part of research, but logically they are and should be listed among deliverables. I found the intel on what's happening in Pi and in the wider governance space very helpful to understand Decred's path. It is often just entertaining because there are so many bad ideas. But there are also things to learn from, e.g. Grin's financial transparency left a good impression.

Social media research was not too popular but I still believe it is important. I would like to see charts of various social media stats over time. Things like follower counts, activity of certain keywords, likes and more sophisticated engagement metrics - should be available to stakeholders. Preferrably with an overlay of key events like announcements and stories in tier 1 media. Maybe there is existing software for it, or [dcrextdata](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrextdata) could support it some day. Yes most (social) media is weird and biased, but it has influence and we need to be aware of it.

I like the idea to minimize friction. Not sure if it's in conflict with the DCC, but perhaps some funds can be used to pay people ""outside"" of the barriers (which might also bootstrap them into full contractors). If we think broader, as Ditto mentioned in their AMA, almost for any question you have somebody in the community knows the answer. I hope one day it is possible to organize intel provided by dozens or hundreds of people in a way that can be easily consumed by stakeholders, while all contributors are rewarded appropriately.

Automating @pi_crumbs - yes please. Ideally Politeia itself would cooperate and generate all sorts of [events](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/736) that can be fed into Matrix, Twitter, etc. I'm still often late to learn about interesting pi activity.

Re report at the end of the program - I think all proposal owners should look at Ditto's example and develop a habit of posting updates. Maybe not biweekly like Ditto, but short monthly updates would be great. Until one large final report is produced there can be a feeling that nothing particular happens, when in fact a lot is being done.","dab6f5937789513ad32bdb6436c8df5d06d42769c74973484acbd333839f082192a7d21c6ba421bda153343fbe0cf262ebbb0fa83530f8e2c66d648ba18aac0b","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","9","5dc39547fa6c9263ca466fb027371ffd6dab36e46360cc16d8702174227d7cc2d66741ca93fcfab2ac040a7f101624e303ac7d68dfd9cbee54309afe02a0eb09",1560121404,0,0,FALSE,NA,"67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f/comments/9","bee",NA,10,10,8,NA

It can be hard to know where to draw the line sometimes. I don't count direct contributions to Pi digest or the Journal as part of the research program, but they are sometimes based on or benefit from research program work (e.g. Pi research produced data which was written about or graphed in Pi digest, and 
made it possible to automate the production of voting stats).

> I like the idea to minimize friction. Not sure if it's in conflict with the DCC, but perhaps some funds can be used to pay people ""outside"" of the barriers (which might also bootstrap them into full contractors).

I think this is worth exploring too and could be a useful approach. I have discussed it with @jy-p and there would at present be some issues with accountability if payment requests are submitted to the CMS on behalf of someone who does not themselves have access. In time I hope this is something the CMS will be able to support well.

Intuitively, we __can__ make profits with our market making strategies by buying low from one client and selling high to another client because our high frequency strategy can make decisions within milliseconds, much faster than normal people especially when market moves a lot.

However, the profit we gain is generated from the market, which means, we take profits from you, from the Decred community. The more profits we gain, the more money you guys lose. 

We're here to help Decred communities, to let more people involve and let those who got interested recently can get a chance to have their own DCR tokens and join the community. It's not fair for them to pay a higher price and lose money, that is why we decide to gain __$0 profit__ from the market.

1.
The situation you described in your first question, is basically called ___orderbook depth___, which means how much DCR or USD you would like to trade in the market. Let's say if there're 100 people, each of them would like to buy 100 DCR at a price of $25, then in this case, you are promised to sell 10,000 DCR with a price higher than $25. However, if there're only 10 people would like to buy 100 DCR, you cannot get a price higher than $25 with the same amount of DCR. 

This is exactly the circumstance you described, if a person want to buy DCR with over 1M USD, it will be pretty hard to get a decent price (please look at table 1 in our proposal). You would see huge pumps and dumps in the market, which is not healthy for the whole community.

In order to improve it, we promise to provide better orderbook depth, to let people who interested in DCR are willing to do their investment. (please look at table 2 in our proposal). It will provide a more stable and reliable market with lower investment risk, and attract more investors.

---

2.
The 'ugly' you mentioned in the article is mainly about wash trading. What is wash trading? A market maker trades with itself, let's say, buy DCR with their own USD and then sell the same amount of DCR to USD. No clients will benefit from these fake tradings. This will generate fake volume and people will believe that the market is pretty hot and there're lots of active investors in the market, which is totally a fraud. 

As a 'good' market maker, we promise to only provide liquidity, that is, we only __passively post__ our orders to the market but we will never __actively take__ any orders from the market.

We are proud to have pretty wide connections in the cryptocurrency world, we are the top tier market maker among top tier exchanges, and some other second tier exchanges. Our strategies are able to provide liquidity over __10M__ a day, and can handle various circumstances 24/7 consistently.

Asides from exchanges, we have helped tens of clients for their ICO and market making program, some of them are the hottest project in recent months. 

It is our honor to grow up with those teams like Decred, and we are confident to provide better market for emerging projects. Good teams deserve the best service.

You can simply google us and learn more about us. We're happy to make more friends in crypto world. ^_^","57c3bf6e3418d0f704a88168c9089c6ddef8f4c641458b843d454ca87290cb34ba45f2eb88af95c27d9a48e68bae2422ba27437696f2bc4b714e08d9c31c6907","0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","8","0734055c1473b1e6e454c46d588ffa9f1bac8c73353eb9481ca8dadacc20c0922f4467448660dbcce2fd0d6f42bc57bc273937532528fe29274342d808f46a04",1565282688,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/8",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

Yes we have several cases which turned out to be pretty successful, such as ___Grin___ and ___Beam___. Even though I cannot provide more details this time, we are one of the most active participants in this market especially in altcoin market. The __Alt__ prefix of __Altonomy__ stands for our interest and confidence in altcoins - the emerging projects which backed by enthusiastic people like you guys.

In the interests of fairness, I have more or less the same comments and questions for each market maker proposal, but there are also a few which are specific to your proposal.

1. Could you estimate how much trading fees will cost per month or for the 6 month term? Could you put a cap on the amount the Treasury would be charged for?
1. Have you provided this kind of service specifically for many other cryptoassets? I think this is relevant for considering the difficulty of setting everything up and the likelihood that everything will go as planned.
1. I am interested in the degree to which market makers are paid to make markets for other cryptoassets - whether Decred is really unusual in not having any party that provides this kind of service.  Would you care to make some general statements about how common this is? I realize you may be constrained in what you can reveal. I notice on your website that the logos of Grin and I think Cardano are floating around, does that mean you have been engaged to provide this kind of service for GRIN and ADA markets?
1. Can you match or better the i2 [offer](https://matrix.to/#/!MIGqWXfLFBwhipPKYL:decred.org/$156527909310923oaewi:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org&via=zettaport.com) of API key type read access for a Decred representative? Do you have any other suggestions about ways in which you could demonstrate that your obligations were fulfilled?
1. You refer to the details of what would be provided as ""tentative metrics"" - what happens if you don't hit those targets?
1. Forgive me for being blunt, but $35k/month (including onboarding fee) seems like a lot to set up and run some trading algorithms with borrowed DCR. I recognize that some portion of this is to cover the risk of trading losses, but I don't have a good sense of how much you would be likely to lose in a month. As I understand it you would aim to break even, and tolerate a small loss. Are there ways in which you could incur a much larger loss than you anticipate? I'm not familiar with market making and would like to understand what the DCR would be paying for in more detail.
1. Lastly, the proposal is in my view incomplete without agreement from the lender about their terms. As jz has also suggested, I would prefer that the lending costs be incorporated within this proposal.","aea6df2edd9d236fdfb89a29619d7bcc66b0fad4934d41e71daa60866c8a046db58490555832f0ceb898969f0adecd56dda3e7dc13a7d5bc54c54730de49760f","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","11","37288478cf4d2d7e1f45b9bfc018183237298e4a78a758384c8d41de65ef3ea9bd9ede187b89bd12b73c3b2de7a1ef794f25b443571bdb7b7e94196f58b77e0e",1565295241,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/11","richard-red",NA,10,10,8,NA

For your first and third question, please look at my reply above, I briefly introduced some ideas of 'good' and 'bad' market making.

The second question is pretty interesting. The reason why people do wash trading is to attract more investors to pump the token price, and they can become billionaires overnight. It will greatly harm the communities especially those who truly believe the ideas for this project.

How to identify wash trading? The simplest way is to look at the daily or hourly volume. Altonomy is a liquidity provider, which will only post our orders to the market rather than take the order and make transaction. If nobody trade with us, we won't produce any volume. In this case, you will witness a stable and gradually growing volume rather than flooding.

Another method is to look at the trade history, if most trades happened within the market spread, which means best bid and best ask didn't cross, we can confidently say they are wash trades.

We can provide a healthy market, where you can make your transactions easily with better price (the best bid price will be as close as possible to the best ask price). The price movement will be more stable to reduce the investment loss of everybody. A good market maker can maintain a solid market like ballast stone. Without market makers, the market will be easily driven by good news or bad news, for emerging projects the price movement will be huge ( imagine the price goes up 100% or goes down 50% when you are asleep). 


We believe the potentials of Decred as we believed Beam and Grin a year ago, that is why we decide to work together with the whole community.","7b54f3fb6c9e7e555f31b281ddd7e509d3412a9f8638453ddbc4be1ff8aa80c562b044db0918ff79b25d703528423ed052215954543cd76a95dd341a5dc77d09","0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","12","8a768c987f2882b94bd18b03fb87ac5811164e3dd8b23ef401b1094755d2fa1b3d5e27da04cb1ee39601fb1fd3f5d8e0bb51d7f62a44318663cc7417646cd60d",1565297510,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/12",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

Yes you are right, market makers are meant to provide liquidity, but not only liquidity. Let me explain it in details.

Decred is at a very early stage, we agree with you, but we have already seen its potentials: DCR has already launched some of the largest exchanges, a pretty stable price, a growing community and a couple of millions daily volume.

However, we have seen a lot of examples of market manipulations, even for some very good projects. The price was controlled by a small group of people rather than the whole community, in the end most people lost faith in the project and nobody would get involve with it anymore. Extreme market movement will damage a project at its early stage.

We are not only providing liquidity, but also providing faith. Not matter how much DCR price has changed, we will always be there (as we signed the contract). We can be the last guy you can find in the market to trade with. We provide liquidity and provide our protect to stabilize the market and maintain a healthy and sustainable growth of Decred community.

Even though the service fee, as you mentioned, is expensive, we believe Decred deserve the best service, and we provided the world-class service to lots of teams at this price level. We believe Decred will be successful one day and we would like to help and contribute to this project.

Looking forward to your vote anyway, it will take some time to validate.","0607bf2806fa2badd3062f2b890849087cc74b85c494586ee001252c8d28f8c24720ccd754b1cc6b6433a3afcd12f715bda8b358470f34f9df3b4a604aa5c004","0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","14","5769d0bf5c88b179510ffa53c570814a42bd585854a2dec0406f795a2df93705d3379d92b9650f3999d657ff672ed7fe85e31f94a4b54f421e34996e98f4560b",1565301052,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/14",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

I believe that acceptance of any market maker proposal illegal, unethical, a waste of money, and a potential project killer. Below I will list the reasons why the MM proposals are so concerning. 

A) Acceptance of It is in violation of Rule 5250
FINRA received comments on Rule 5250 (Payments for Market Making) in response to Regulatory Notice 17-14, which requested comment on FINRA rules impacting capital formation.3 FINRA believes it would be useful to solicit further comment on the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 5250 as part of the retrospective rule review process.
Rule 5250 explicitly prohibits a member or associated person from accepting payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, from an issuer or its affiliates and promoters, for publishing a quotation, acting as a market maker or submitting an application in connection therewith. The rule excepts: (1) payment for bona fide services, including, but
not limited to, investment banking services (including underwriting compensation and fees); (2) reimbursement of any payment for registration imposed by the SEC or state regulatory authorities and for listing fees imposed by a self-regulatory organization; and
(3) any payment expressly provided for under the rules of a national securities exchange that are effective after being filed with, or filed with and approved by, the SEC pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act.
The prohibition on accepting payments for market making, originally articulated in a Notice to Members in 1975 and codified in 1997, is intended to assure that members act in an independent capacity when publishing a quotation or making a market in an issuer’s securities.4
FINRA has stated that such payments may be viewed as a conflict of interest since they may influence the member’s decision as to whether to quote or make a market in a security and, thereafter, the prices that the member would quote. FINRA seeks answers to the following questions with respect to this rule:
                 
2) Unethical - A market maker providing services for a fee can be construed as market manipulation and a violation of the spirit of the law. 
 Even if one does not believe Decred needs to follow FINRA, CBOE and SEC rules why would the Decred Treasury pay for market making when in the real world firms like Citadel and Viirtu actually pay for order flow.  The is correct, Citadel and Virtu pay to receive order flow.  If Grapefruit provides such amazing service.  Please provide a list of projects that you have provided market making services for. We look forward to seeing the list.

3) Waste of Money - Drain on the Treasury. This is the third and troubling aspect of paying for market makers as a service. It can be broken down into 2 parts.  
First, there will likely be no real benefits of paying for market making as a service.  Besides short term liquidity be a market maker provides no value and will come at a fee of $30,000 per month. Payment to stabilize a market can be viewed as market manipulation.  Once again if Grapefruit can provide a list of success and failures for their market making as a service that would be great.  The community should know more about Grapefruit and their service.  We look forward to seeing a list.
Secondly, why would I give a market market maker a free  put / call to trade around?  That is what that $30,000 a month is - it is a option for Grapefruit to trade around their own book.  If you would you don't understand that, you don't understand how markets work.  

4) A Potential Project Killer-  
    As someone that has spoken with regulators and on several matters I can say.  The regulators know a few things really well.  First, they know trading.  Second, they understand markets and market mechanics.  A payment to a market maker might cause an inquiry for an investigation on if Decred is a security or not.  Even if one does not believe Decred is a security, just an inquiry could derail the entire project.  Kin, for example spent $5 million on legal fees in a short amount of time.  What happens if Decred ends up spending $15 - $20 million on a prolonged investigation.  Say goodbye to the Treasury.  Will the all the coders work for free if there is no treasury left.  The answer is no.  Look at all the crypto projects that have fallen apart because there is no way to compensate the coders.  

Secondly, this does not address the MM proposal directly, but the regulators are also watching the Atomic Swap market, as they believe it is a type of exchange activity and should be regulated.  Don't believe me?  Check out the Fintech Forum at the SEC on May 31, 2019.
https://www.sec.gov/video/webcast-archive-player.shtml?document_id=053119fintechforum

I believe that acceptance of any MM proposal will provide little long term value and have a chance to kill the project.  A killed project would not be a good SOV.","57fef751e09904a4b593192b0d896cf48799246208c26aacdb5c56517177d9a3591e05e8fd78e36cdda15eab1e1cc187d438ce7344a4c03738e704e8e055850d","528b7aa72ff033016b3f284786d922aaf4841dd3e98787b1b075b542a67c6539","15","2cd656b33ca7c36b233e11c09a675da7861f4ea8211c5d7e1b739dc9d0a139e5cb466e611529352e2b3b2540a2afc901b6c3098d7e64595c5528017c7fde800d",1565353356,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/15",NA,NA,16,14,10,NA

I believe no one will promise he will 100% making money using his market making strategies, otherwise he will become the richest person in the world. The most important metric for a market maker is about the spread, how close the spread you can provide, which stands for how much benefit you can bring to retailers. Idealy the best spread should be zero, because for a certain product its value is fixed, the buy price and sell price should be identical. This is the circumstance when no market maker can make money from the market. 
In this case I would say, in general, the closer spread we provide the less profit we gain. That is the reason why we put __spread__ as our No.1 metrics.
2. As I said, the simplest way to identify fake trades is to see if trades happened within the market spread. If so, we are comfortable to say it is a wash trade, because you didn't provide any liquidity to the retailers who really want to trade.
3. Based on my knowledge, I don't think market making will damage reputation of Decred to any extent. Let alone crypto market, MM is so common in the __equity market__, even Apple and Google have their market makers providing liquidity to their stakeholders. I don't think MM is a bad thing, on the contrary, it is a symbol of a sophisticated market.","72618cff62130b2492df9ccf216eb9cf54bbd0da60becb9dba22fd6ee842b45f3f9dc5c27cf0e0e9fa9e0d024e9640ba55164df8da4e502c58e9df6542e2060a","0d003e0b388cb8f86f98eafa56fa69a6c0f336c5037bc5b8c7f6ea8e4c08873b","18","5362665e5761d65aa020cee83864417cf1bf98f040dcbe6ab3b7a68621cc05145426b169cb3a6240434cdd9c31d5567df4e9185dc85012797994c8e0293b4308",1565375439,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/18",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

Firstly I would like to clarify is that, setting up market making strategy is far from an easy task. Since DCR has been trading across various exchanges and we have to set different accounts and handle various exchange exceptions. There are tons of different exceptions you may encounter if you are familiar with these exhcanges. It is quite a burden for our team to have everything running smoothly 24/7, and that's why we charge onboarding fee.

I am concerned at the lack of the option to vote for none of the MMs. With the current voting choice, this option is not catered for and in effect, we are all assumed to want a MM, the question only being which of the three we want.

>  [Quote from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/cm2uw1/decred_only_needs_one_market_maker/): 
""It was suggested that we approve the proposal with the largest Yes - No vote tally, as it should be the choice most voters are content with. Should proposal A have 70% approval and proposal B have 65% approval, proposal A would be approved and proposal B would not. If everyone understands this, they are free to vote Yes on as many proposals as they are happy with (vote Yes on all if they want a MM and don't care which one it is). Politeia will be updated to allow multiple options, but until that time we'll have to build social consensus around the best way to handle these more complex votes.""","77cacf37cc9c93d9f8e499e1273a976f317602e18e3bc226539c014203ba2200515381423450f05410f0818ae7336904efa0bb9bbfbe667d4e03fc4f05cd4302","5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","23","34a5d10a8cc18c697595a61a440fe989942838566e400e39eaa00d539b6b3a96f8f94a285dcfad0d8cd34160b91620b25e1b8c0634907264cd4948b1648cf90a",1565407681,0,0,FALSE,NA,"772d083fef79fa2e443d8424b353deadc3af69c8d8764e473cb200f98f356c60/comments/23",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

a) Regulatory legality and compliance
b) The Ethics of Decred paying for such liquidity.

I am not well versed in the legal/regulations however I will say that Decred MUST maintain it's independence and reputation at all costs. Any action which may be adversely perceived in the eyes of regulators must be avoided. Only BTC is classed as a commodity, I do not assume DCR is safe until explicitly stated as such.

As such, I request that the community and MM proposers research, comment and address potential risks associated with Decreds direct engagement of a MM.

**As an alternative idea** It may be desirable for Decred introduce a layer of separation from the direct hiring of MMs. Decred may be better placed employing a project manager team (on which we do due diligence) who are tasked with enhancing market infrastructure. The treasury funds this PM team who shall then exercise their expertise in regulation compliance, legal matters and market infrastructure.

At this point, I am not convinced that hiring a MM is a good idea. The purpose of hiring a MM is to increase the depth of buy and sell sides of order books for the benefit of people who want to quickly make large trades.

Not counting the loaned collateral, these proposals tend to have an average monthly cost of roughly **10% of the current treasury inflow**. If DCR prices were to dip back down to price levels seen earlier this year, that could quickly become **20% of the current treasury inflow**.

I do not believe that it is a wise use of treasury funds to spend 10%-20% of the entire treasury inflow on what is essentially subsidizing whales so that they don't have to pay a slippage premium for immediate fills.

Some relevant background: Checkmate and I have discussed their becoming a Decred contractor and contributing to the project's research effort (and more broadly). While there is some scope for Checkmate and I to collaborate on the [Decred Open Source Research program](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/67de0e901143400ae2f247391c4d5028719ffea8308fbc5854745ad859fb993f), Checkmate's research interests and skills are quite different to mine. Checkmate shared a bullet-point list of subjects they would like to cover, and I suggested to develop it into a proposal and pursue it independently (if the proposal is approved).

From an organizational perspective, this approach makes more sense to me than trying to fit Checkmate's research into the open source research program. Having the proposed work be part of the established program would make me responsible for deciding which aspects are worthwhile and for overseeing the work, and I would be accountable for those decisions when it's time for the next open source research proposal. This would not be a great setup for anyone. Checkmate's approach is different enough to my own that it should have its own proposal and be evaluated independently. 

I will be voting Yes, I think $2,000 is reasonable for the work already done and a further $12,000 should provide enough runway to develop this approach and for us to see how it progresses - which can inform stakeholder voting on any subsequent proposal.

In general, this approach of approving budgets for specific research programs led by specific individuals or small groups feels like a good fit to me. The nature of research is such that one can't guarantee what the outcome will look like, as it will depend on how the research unfolds. Therefore I think it makes sense to handle funding on the basis of programs where specific individuals/groups lead research efforts in specific areas, with proposals that span fairly short periods of time (3-12 months) and are therefore regularly reviewed by stakeholders.","179b4817df2fee9d6b8155bcedbd15b0b03c0fd7e0d0b48944c160073e3369b914e29c65cf2834e3e948ebcf845daa6e46e3febfa7f62331b762528b531ca103","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","1","180b5e3c61413a26eeafbfad39ec73e5f77199699821a251211ae1ab134bb231072702199e3dbd1d15a334e8bce10a5eaeaa7a13d6b0ecfc5690a6c8fb9a7700",1563457016,0,0,FALSE,NA,"78b50f218106f5de40f9bd7f604b048da168f2afbec32c8662722b70d62e4d36/comments/1","richard-red",NA,17,17,8,NA

Checkmate has made valuable contributions to growing awareness of Decred on social media, and his published work on Medium has been of high quality and has created a strong following.

The scope of his work is extremely complimentary to the existing approved work in marketing, events and research, and the assets will be repurposable.

Denni's [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd) asking for payment in arrears was a corner case resulting from his going way over budget before he became a contractor as a means to recoup that work (and I haven't seen him around for a while...). Checkmate's situation is of being the first to go through the proper process of becoming a contractor with the expectation of needing stakeholder approval for his funding. 

The basic official contractor path (or the traditional one anyway, which hasn't been changed afaik), is:

1. Work and demonstrate value
2. Ask to become a contractor (or be asked)
3. In your first invoice, bill in arrears for the free work you did knowing you may never get paid for it (i.e. you proved skin-in-the-game by taking on risk, and get rewarded if that bet pays off). I think this is fair, and an important value proposition to new contractors who are already making a large leap of faith by doing what can be a large amount of work for free (and that can happen). 

I think the amount asked for is reasonable, especially considering his work has already proved popular/valuable (e.g. already it has been included in an [investment thesis](https://www.blockheadcap.com/post/decred-investment-thesis), presumably by people buying into DCR and increasing the price). What's new here is that this process is now going through stakeholder approval, not just the normal invoicing process. Would be curious to know if there has been a change in process, or if this is just checkmate wanting to err on the side of transparency and giving the stakeholders an avenue to voice their opinion on the matter. 

To add a data point to this, when I went through the process of becoming a contract (back in October, right as Politeia was launching), I decided not to bill in arrears for prior work I'd done, even though I was told I could and it was a decent chunk of work, because I was very eager to impress and grateful for the opportunity. However, I also realized that that possibility/promise of getting paid for that work was a big factor in my deciding to take the plunge and go for it. And I told myself that if I had the opportunity to speak up for this practice generally I would take it, hence this comment. 

Am curious to hear any stakeholder opinions on this.","cc88288586e93c12dda893ea1c396f9e8f4ffa25aa46dbfeef4f521025ac9bdac76fbebf482c3bb9ae6f96463c70061c9f33585a4690417c4cf6b83e98066a06","1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","7","60bd46dfad1f04203a277f23a3c1b3643769dc8b88de28dea931ee70001d4125e22c59a30245f14c65ff7cc577fe5a91d53fd4d2a92a0f1c4ada744c16aa450d",1563577013,0,0,FALSE,NA,"78b50f218106f5de40f9bd7f604b048da168f2afbec32c8662722b70d62e4d36/comments/7","s_ben",NA,15,15,8,NA

Quite frankly, this person is a breath of fresh air and has already proved value within the community.  I had been periodically checking $DRC & #decred tags on Twitter and while there are dedicated individuals consistently posting, Checkmate has gotten quite a bit of attention directed at Decred and some of the highest engagement levels per tweet I've seen relating to this project in a long time.  I also appreciate their willingness to engage with all sorts, including those critical of the project, and have civilized discussion.  Not that this is anything new, as most Decred folk I've noticed are extremely civilized in discourse, but people like this are amazing for PR awareness and representing what I hope to be the average caliber of person invested in this project. 

It also goes without saying that the research that Checkmate has put forth is also fantastic and I look forward to seeing what is to come in the future.  The research alone is worth the $12,000 being asked.  The previous paragraph is why I think the $2000 in arrears is also well worth it.  Not only have they put out great research but they have been extremely active on Twitter raising awareness and promoting the project in a positive light.  I understand why we want to be careful in setting precedence for arrears, but in this case the quality of work is so high that I think anybody who has read Checkmate's work and seen them on Twitter knows that the extra $2000 will be minuscule compared to the amount of value that has been provided and that will be provided in the future.

This puts the Decred stakeholders in a strong position as there is no expectation that they _should_ approve the proposal or make the payment. 

In my view this would be a good kind of precedent to set - it tells prospective contributors that they can get on with contributing to the project now and if the stakeholders see value in their work they can be paid for it later. This fits with Decred's approach to approving contractors, where they must demonstrate the quality of their work product before being allowed to bill for it.

This is unlike the tutorials proposal going over budget, in the sense that there was no prior agreement with Checkmate. Checkmate did the work freely, we have a free choice to pay for it or not.

Overall, my judgement of what has been said is that there is a general feeling of value for money from this proposal by stakeholders. The budget in arrears seems to have approval from most stakeholders and I appreciate the precedent set by this. 

Indeed, my understanding was that an initial skin-in-the-game demonstration was necessary to show contribution to Decred (based off this page https://blog.decred.org/2017/07/25/Decred-Recruiting/).

As such, I will proceed to open this proposal as it stands today for voting on 30/7/2019 to allow any final discussion points on the above.

The unusual proposal you refer to was handled well and created a _good_ precedent, IMO. The contractor received an initial approval from stakeholders, started work, burned the initial budget quickly and went into deep overrun without notifying about his underestimation timely (i.e. _before_ overrunning), nor about extra budget necessary to continue. On top of that, he went over with extra work not in scope of the initial proposal. Judging this was too much for Treasury managers and the only good way to resolve this was to submit a proposal, which was done. The proposal received strong opposition, I guess mainly because it was a huge surprise for everyone. The proposal was abandoned (i.e. not approved), and I think it is now a great precedent that would prevent similar undesirable behavior, not invite new one.

Perhaps I did not fully grasp your concern though.

As for paying for past work done without prior approval, it's totally fine. It all boils down to what we get vs what we pay. In case of Denni's proposal, there was no consensus that the product was worth the extra requested funds. In case of Checkmate's proposal, $2K for past research is within what I think is reasonable.","fb9bc025e34caff89841ea4298f38580e0f3f206443fc81ec86ac7955f1af2def99b8bc08f7dbb29182c555c400ac9d273a5263896ab8a7b6b83f93959e6f80d","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","19","f3b5177c2cd4937e1aa603dc283b2a9ea6647394a5352bb5888e2d04b5c459d2019d8662c7507007a3d70c6b5611990f1e731684b75b72f46a863dc8277e160a",1564907766,0,0,FALSE,NA,"78b50f218106f5de40f9bd7f604b048da168f2afbec32c8662722b70d62e4d36/comments/19","bee",NA,10,10,8,NA

I appreciate that FTL talked about bitcoin early.  That is different to me than paying them to talk about us.  Gavin may have expressed appreciation about FTL getting the word out about Bitcoin early on...but that is very different than Bitcoin sponsoring FTL early on.

If we choose to sponsor FTL we would in some eyes be financially supporting a political stance/ethos.

One possibility if there is high alignment (and I don't really know if there is or not) is a ""echo chamber syndrome"" we see in controlled feeds today where we attract people who think like the majority of the community and thus we grow only in that small subset of political thinking even though the technology is fundamentally useful and attractive to the larger whole (what is libertarian now...10% of Americans (and based on my brief investigation I believe that the show is basically ""American Libertarian"" which is different than most forms of libertarianism globally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism))

1. Yes, we have worked with Bitcoin.com, HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero, and Dash. On top of that, we have worked with MANY crypto businesses and crypto accepting businesses. We got in early and are considered to be a market maker in that segment. 

2. No telling. Advertising is an art, not a science. We are audio. We don't have click-through rates. This is the biggest problem with audio ads: they are hard to track. Also, I imagine these as branding ads, not direct response. Branding ads are intended to create a reputation and keep your product top of mind. Can you think of a jingle for a product from your youth? If you can, branding was successful. 

I can guarantee that your ads will be heard on 190+ US radio stations, 2 satellite channels, dozens of streams, get 100,000+/monthly podcast downloads resulting millions of listening sessions per month, but I can't give you any kind of results, other than many advertisers stay with us month after month. 

3. The show is heard on many platforms. The biggest are radio and podcast. Neilson rates radio listening and that is how we get our estimates. General numbers are available on the Internet, but we don't pay the $30k per year for the use of the more specific numbers. I can give you screenshots of our podcast downloads 

4. We are A LOT less expensive than any other Top 30 radio program that I have ever seen. Like 1/10th as much. Like I said in the presentation, we did well and don't have to take advertisers that we don't want, and we don't have much of a sales department either. So, our rates are low, but we are making enough to keep broadcasting. So, things are fine. 

I just did a quick google search on underwriting costs for NPR. It looks like you can get a nice web-banner on their site (No on air presence at all) for the cost of this package. I don't know if that 20 grand would get you a banner for a month or a year. https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/get-started/

FTL is the best value in advertising, especially if you want to hit males in the US. 

4. Ditto is a PR firm. Usually PR firms attempt to get you interviews, they don't place ads, generally. That is the job of an ad agency. I have lots of critiques of ad agencies, after 20 years in this business. We can talk about that too, if you want. :-)

This proposal is for a full radio/podcast live ad package which includes 30 second recorded audio ads promoting Decred to our national and international audience.  It also includes live (not recorded) promotions of Decred during our show segments.  Our show airs live and recorded on over 190 radio stations at various times, but we are not on ""throughout the day"", so we can't run ads outside of our showtimes.  The stations air other shows during other times of the day and we cannot control the ads that run during those other shows.

John, thanks for your questions. There are 2 main ways to listen to the show: the live version and the recorded version. The Live promotions are at least :60 seconds in length, and are part of the show, as opposed to a recorded ad. So, they are heard on both versions of the show. The :30 podcast ads are heard in the recorded version only. The :30 second radio ads are heard in the live version. If you wonder “Why not have the ads that air in the live version just air in the recorded one too?” The answer is that podcast audiences have a much lower tolerance for ads than do live listeners. 

Obviously, these numbers are estimates. Because of the way that radio listeners are quantified (they are counted by the 15-minute listening segment, not by the 3-hour radio program) we can claim millions of listens per month. That isn’t a perfect way to count, but neither is by the listener. A listener could be a person that listens to the whole show on podcast, on the treadmill at the gym or it could be a mom in the car for 10 minutes with screaming kids. The short answer to your question is about 250,000 weekly listeners. We don’t count daily because different days of the week have different audience size.","d627dd9da5ee54ead25b952177f7a307f4d06d37fd6490c825acecc83cc79a93399bd0af5f14d038d16d81a79cbe50af134e7d66e89873be2221dbb53da2d406","b719b0bee46a2fb08a1d31f5b81577f886c1d51707da860645757ea28cc19e03","25","751a2d8b132eef73cdbfef079434b3a3818db5afcc451af86f703b6f8dbee7d8b086bc9530f90904ca3744e61c89a1ad725827c3ca85f30852bc846f8ca76103",1543960135,0,0,FALSE,NA,"7fe5d07a4ffff7dc6a83383018823d880b1c1db0a29305e74934817cf2b4e2ce/comments/25",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

There are some inaccuracies here. Yes, we had a DASH proposal. We advertised them for close to 2 years and then they began focusing on Venezuela and we parted ways. The DASH proposal expires this month, but it went live months ago and they are not currently on the air with us.  I was clear in my responses here that DASH HAD been an advertiser. That is what we do, we are a radio program and we sell ads. DASH’s slot is available and we offered it to y’all. There have been some months that we get 85% of our revenue from crypto. We are a show that is friendly to crypto. 

Yes, the price is different from the previous DASH proposal because pricing for crypto has gone down recently. If it goes down after this proposal is approved, we still will provide the ads that we offered at the price we promised. 

Yes, we modified this proposal from our DASH proposal. Why is that bad? It is a good proposal that lays out our Major Sponsor proposal quite well. You can find our packages here: https://www.freetalklive.com/advertise. 

If a car salesman sells 2 different people the same make/model and color of car, I don’t think anyone would call it a scandal. 

Regarding Smartcash: That IS NOT an active proposal. It was just me seeing what they would have to say. I wanted to see what would happen here first, but again, is there a problem with us having 2 up-and-coming cryptos as advertisers? Should I include an exclusivity option here?

Here is what Liz Bagot (Ditto AVP) posted in Slack regarding this proposal: 

> The question was put to Ditto in the marketing channel, and I wanted to post it here as well. We've been asked to weigh in on the radio proposal in Politeia, and here's what we think:

> Generally, we recommend an integrated approach in which we know the message, who we want to say it to, and where those people are. Maybe it’s radio, maybe it’s not. If you’re going for broad awareness, it may make sense down the line to go for a broader radio play. However, we think paid advertising is premature at this stage — we have yet to work through Decred’s branding and messaging, which we need to nail down and make airtight before we approach the broader public. For the sake of putting on a solid public front, we need to agree on how best to tell the Decred story and position ourselves, both internally and externally. This is the first order of business for Decred’s work with Ditto — and what we’ll be discussing with a couple Decred folks this Thursday. We recommend focusing on getting the free earned media stuff first (which Ditto has already started). Once we’ve established a strong external narrative, we can consider how and if paid opportunities might complement our efforts.

Implementing this proposal in the current form is against what I perceive as Decred ethos. But I do like your contributions to cryptocurrency, your audience and your network. Full length shows and interviews, or even commentary, would be great to broadcast.

Long version below.

I very like concept, but not the format:

> Per show, this means Decred receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) live promotion per show. For the recorded ads, we’ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of “Word of Mouth” campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.

This is my biggest concern for this proposal. 30 second ads sound like cheap shilling. What deep, thoughtful information can one squeeze in 30 seconds? I don't want to see ""Decred ads"" or even ""promotion"". I'd love to see full time shows and interviews that explain why Decred is so amazing, e.g. ""Decred is one of the few places where you can have real sovereignty"". I don't want sovereignty to be packaged into a product that can be sold in 30 seconds. Using different voices for 30 second ads makes it even worse, it sounds like mind manipulation. You can't fake a ""word of mouth"", and if you can, I don't want it that way. Sorry this sounds harsh, but when reading first time it raised my eyebrows so I wanted to share what I feel.

I'm also not sure about the banners because I hate all ads that interrupt my thoughts, and always filter them.

That said, I do like the concept of using radio in general. I cannot verify all claims, but if they are true I am thankful and respectful for doing a big contribution to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency movement.

What would be great instead is to have full length shows and interviews with our community members because they understand and can explain Decred well. There are a lot of topics to cover like sovereignty, skin in the game, conflicts of interest, aligned incentives, forks, ASIC resistance, misconceptions about PoW energy usage, ICOs, Politeia's resistance to manupulation and more. News from Decred space would be great too, we have [quite a lot](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) going on! Another approach is commentary on what happens in the space.

The only short ""ads"" I would tolerate is announcements of the shows so more people don't miss it, e.g. inserting ""By the way tomorrow at X we will have Y tell us Decred's approach to Z"" at the end of a block about Z.

@oregonisaac raised a good point that sponsoring the whole radio can be interpreted by the public as sponsoring certain political stance/ethos. We shall be really careful about our messaging, and it is impossible to audit everything that happens on the radio. One way to address this is to pay only for the shows and not sponsor the whole radio.

What I liked:

* General concept of using radio.
* Past contribution to Decred - show with Marco. I haven't listened to it, but the sole fact of its existence is nice.
* Past contribution to cryptocurrency space.
* Libertarian audience sounds like it aligns with Decred. I'm not 100% sure as I don't know them. I hope they are not zealots - we need people who think for themselves.
* The price looks reasonable for the network of your size.
* Appreciate how you engaged in comments.

Notes:

* "":30 second"" reads a bit confusing, just ""30 second"" would do.

If this proposal is voted No, a reworked iteration can be posted later and I would suggest to focus it on non-ad content.","370da2f315e6746c4f1dc69d3a4cf635143ce09ab04b5b5ee61aec033e56f58d3f72351ff89cf17d24b3932f1fccea938b306b3d324b6122474616b3a8eb2006","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","41","46e416699d2ee3b2aecdcbf5d7b361e4f404f6e9177cd17f8b085ab1a639bfac13927fad3dc5d31f1bea92d5149972ed3e0a2dda76d8830ddaae298094589205",1544079623,0,0,FALSE,NA,"7fe5d07a4ffff7dc6a83383018823d880b1c1db0a29305e74934817cf2b4e2ce/comments/41","bee",NA,13,12,9,NA

It is a good idea, but your suggestions on implementation very likely won’t work. You want to change the format of a very successful, 16 year old, radio program, #27 in the nation with millions of monthly listens, to fit your preferences. Sure, everyone wants to do that. We have a dog vitamin supplement company that has advertised with us for years. I would bet, if asked, they would love us to talk all about dog health and stuff. The reality is that if we did such a thing, it would destroy listenership. I can't make the Decred Show, I can't even make the Crypto Show. It won't fly, or at least I don't believe that it would fly on the radio on weekdays. What you are talking about is a podcast, not a radio program. If someone makes the Decred podcast. I will happily advise my listeners to go take a listen. It is a fine idea, but this implementation of it just won't work. If you wanted to talk about total sponsorship of FTL, where Decred commits for the year at the price of 30 grand per month, we can definitely talk about that. 

I would further ad that this is the package that we sold Roger Ver to promote Bitcoin, back in 2011 or 2012, and Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver and Charlie shrem credit us with giving Bitcoin that initial boost that made it the phenom that it is today.","929e4355374160a71f31dc8bc6a8f50ffb4a5c9be013bc861871807323d2f66cb0b4b00f3e943a06fe69e1c735dd3a4bae0204ff668da77a29e4c753984c250a","f4902815caf342eaf8f1ca12826d49bedad71d36eebc7cff73616c696da9e09a","42","87adcfd25f076a93381665aaa26dceea1623ed591315fb1f67e8d1bff096541cf15e7aa7ce14d77ba43056382df8cdab14b50fda8da67e46e9867c5847dc2b04",1544109734,0,0,FALSE,NA,"7fe5d07a4ffff7dc6a83383018823d880b1c1db0a29305e74934817cf2b4e2ce/comments/42",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

Look, if we need to resubmit later, that is fine, we will be here. We have been on the air for 16 years and talking about crypto since 2010. 

But can you ask Ditto some things for me? 
1. Is Ditto an Ad Agency or a PR firm, or some kind of hybrid?
2. How many ad campaigns have they placed for crypto companies and what was the longest time frame that one of those schedules ran on a single venue?
3. What is their branding philosophy?  Do they believe in sticking with one media and creating a relationship with the audience or a haphazard media mix?
4. Will they be producing a radio ad themselves? Do they have a studio? What mics do they use? 
5. Will they be taking a 15% cut of the ad buy or are they going to pay a net rate. 

I don't want to sound confrontational, but I just deal with PR firms all of the time and they are great for placing interviews but they rarely have anything to do with ad buys.

IMO, this proposal, just like the previous Decredex proposal from the same user, shows a total disconnect from the project, the community, and the principles on which Decred is built upon.

1. The treasury isn't meant as a bank from which to fund your personal ventures, business ideas or experimentation. If you are to convince stakeholders to approve your proposal **you will need to demonstrate clearly how it would benefit the project** and not your business. I'm sure at some point stakeholders may be inclined to take some risks on innovative ideas that have clear potential benefits but maybe for now, it would be best to **consider stakeholders as being very conservative and careful in their spending**.

2. **Technical words have specific meanings.** If someone doesn't grasp the meanings and concepts behind those words and attempts to use them in an amalgam of tasty selling points on a checklist, it will fail miserably. The Decred community is composed of  extremely talented devs who have been in the space for years, hardcore fans who take to heart to stay informed, and stakeholders who have money at stakes, which means for them, making the best decision is paramount. If you want to bring meaningful words like ""decentralized"" to the discussion, you better make sure you understand what it means and what are the implications of these terms in the context of your proposal.

3. Being a technical community; claims of profit, market valuations/predictions, investment models, and general claims of ""future popular trends in cryptos"", will most likely be seen as vaporware and distractions. The main selling point of a proposal for building software in this project should probably **focus primarily on the direct improvement to the project** you expect, and on precisely how it will be implemented on a technical level.

4. The community will vote! If you do not engage with the community prior to posting a proposal, you do not gather ideas, and advice, you do not verify basic support and interest beforehand, you are deliberately reducing immensely your chances of seeing your proposal go through. To take a bad example: **Don't be that politician, whose name you see for the first time, on a ballot.**

5. Words are not enough to prove your capability. **The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you are capable of doing what you say.** Decred being open-source, show past contributions to this or other projects (emphasis on verifiable source-code). If you want to work with current devs, actually work with them and make sure you can get the DCC (Decred Contract clearance) and simply get along with other contractors in the project. It's sad but not everybody is cut-out for open-source and blockchain development. Ultimately, **you cannot expect stakeholders to blindly take a leap of faith** that everything will ""work out"".


As a summary, if you want to contribute, maybe taking the project as an example would be a good start. You are more likely to gain support by underselling/over-delivering. Technical accuracy is mandatory. Put forth smaller, solid blocks to build foundations within this community, rather than showing a castle of cards.","7810b868694f2e9017183bf9e975658e0e633818c566c84455c6b35ad53e7c22e527bc0832e5d693725743848d47a73f90df511843c098728f455c8540e29b05","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","2","cd6a23f00fdb9ea66daee6f4cee7418800202596dc8f1d437ed536392dc62d79cdb1505f2c639d94f077aea35c0e23f2438f417c5e2f81a1f59888259a532c04",1543987139,0,0,FALSE,NA,"85fc65cef080cfc3564906fd3d488b827d74fc99bb29143ed8aa6c400b765be9/comments/2","nnnko56",NA,15,15,8,NA

If you're just looking for a short response to this proposal, just read his comment and stop reading mine; it's long.

Seemed easiest just to quote the entire proposal with my comments inserted; here goes:
> # What
> 
> **USDD stable coin**
> 
> **The joint company - between REUM and Moentum have created a USD-backed token.**

To be clear, has this token already been created? If so, links please?

> 
> **USDD** - is a stable coin built as the currency which can be purchased with crypto (all established exchange coins) or fiat (debit card or bank transfer) by users, **REUM** seeks funding to complete the stable coin GUI, which allows users to purchase stable coins to be backed by **Decred (DCR)** as remeedable upon the USD value, each USD is pegged 1:1 to each **USDD**. 

So is REUM starting an exchange to allow the purchase of USDD, that's going to support ""all established exchange coins"" & fiat? Is the development required for that included in this proposal, or is that separate? Or is this promise contingent on [Decredex](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc) being funded?

Also, let me get this straight: USDD is backed by DCR, but pegged to USD, am I right? What happens if the USD value of the DCR backing USDD goes down; how is the peg retained? Also, who holds the DCR used for backing USDD?

> # Why
> 
> Our in-house studies has revealed stable coins as the main cryptocurrency technology for us to concentrate our efforts on in 2019 and our external online research referencing to a report, entitled the **Cryptoasset Market Coverage**.
> 
> Outlining a number of predictions for the virtual currency markets. 
>
> *The report assets that over 90 percent of “cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade” and it anticipates that such a state will propel the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency markets, according to* **Satis Crypto Market Predictions:** 
> 
> **$500 Billion** in 2019, **$1 Trillion** by 2021 and **$3.57 trillion** by 2028, while 90% of crypto currency asset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years, stable currency is about to dominate the development conversations around digital currency over the next year.*

OK, I get it, a lot of people think stable coins are the next big thing. There are already quite a few: Tether, Dai, TrueUSD, USD Coin, Paxos, and I'm sure I missed several. How will USDD be better than these existing solutions? In other words, why yet another stable coin? What's wrong with the existing coins that USDD solves?

> All **USDD** on exchanges will be backed 1:1 with **Decred (DCR)** and valued pegged at USD, providing an obvious route to 'in-house' digitally implemented store of value provision for **DCR**, during harsh market periods and the peg will allow **Decred** to become part of the new securities market emerging within cryptocurrency. **USDD** with merge the **Decrediton GUI** for the USDD stable coin wallet solution.

Again, still haven't explained how that peg holds when DCR goes down in value.

Also, you're proposing making changes to Dcredition, which will certainly require a [Decred Contractor Clearance](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). Has anyone from your company obtained a DCC? If so, please list those individuals.
 
> **USDD** is redeemable for USD, simply by entering your wallet address into the **USDD portal** and upload your USDD currency to get conversion back to fiat or to DCR, any verified account that passes the USDD industry standard KYC/AML check is legally entitled to redeem **USDD** for USD.

Who will be running the USDD portal and enforcing the KYC/AML standards?

> # How
> 
> **Decred** will provide **USDD** with an immediate paid up collateral model for the asset backed element of stable coins – it is a hybrid model based on a simple mathematical formula 1:1 to 1:1 pegs for value and asset.
> 
> - asset backed by **DCR**
> - value backed by USD

You mentioned profits; who makes the profits? REUM or the Decred Treasury?

Still waiting to hear a clear explanation of how this peg really works.

Decred does not have turing-complete smart contracts; only simple Bitcoin-like script. How in the world are you going to do KYC with bitcoin-like script?

""regulation proof currency"" What does that even mean?

DCR already works fine for cross-border payments; and escrow is already possible with 2-of-3 multisig. Why reinvent the wheel?

Spot Quote LLC doesn't seem to be doing very well financially; the financial report for the year 2017 indicates a **loss of $2,993 USD**. Doesn't seem like a very successful company. (Since this is an SEC-regulated company, financial reports are public; source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/1800/18007859.pdf)

First off, this Bank Token. Bank Token has a webpage, but isn't listed on CoinMarketCap; has it launched yet? Also, the Telegram group has a total of 9 members, and is basically a ghost town (mostly posts from Fabian). Not what I'd call a success. Why will USDD not suffer the same fate?

Why do you need a location to house a development team? What's wrong with a remote team?

Decred community is a broad group; can you be more specific? Also, Telegram is not bridged to the main Matrix/Slack/Discord chat; so that's not the preferred communication platform.

As mentioned before, I question if this is really needed.

You have an exact figure here; does that mean you've already negotiated with them? Can I contact them to confirm you've spoken with them regarding this?
 
> -  for international business travel to negotiate with Banks, Fintech groups and development teams 
> 
> *$20,000 per annum*

It's 2018; video conferencing is a thing; is all that travel really needed?

> -  to develop office to allow international communication, teleconference kits, SaaS, also to implement a blockchain oriented voice solution, thus cutting our travel costs
> 
>  *$8,000 per annum*

Why do you need a special blockchain oriented voice solution? What's wrong with existing generic solutions?

> -  to bring external development work in-house into our newly created office, also to allow us to integration and staff hires to upgrade our current offices to support the stable coin business, also to onboard additional sales staff year on year as the stable coin market grows 
> 
> *$20,000 per annum* per staff member, over 4 year period

So is there one office, or multiple offices? How many staff members do you anticipate? Also, $20k is on the low end for developers, I'm suspicious of the quality of work you'll get for that rate.

> -  to purchase an electric vehicle as a USDD stable coin branded vehicle, providing constant advertising as parked in the city of London, also used as the HQ vehicle, parking outside of conferences and blockchain events across the UK and Europe for fintech conferences for consistent UK national and European (Euro Tunnel/Le Shuttle) based travel.
> 
> *$35,000 per annum* 

Are you buying a new electric vehicle every year or what? How in the world do you come up with the ridiculous price of $35,000 per annum? Maintenance costs can't be anywhere near that high. Or are you buying a brand-new Tesla with a payment plan? Also, who gets the car at the end of the 4 years?

Historically, Decred has not paid exchange listing fees; I see no reason why we'd change that now.

First of all thanks for the proposal submission. Frankly speaking, i have not heard of your exchange before, but from a very brief glance and short look up on google, it does seems that your exchange is as legit as it can be, and has been around for 5-6 years awith  a healthy amount of users base on the active users in the ""trollbox"". How many of those of those are legit however, remain in question.

I am however, very intrigued by your proposal because you are the first to offer a basket of lesser common currencies pairing, namely RUB like you mentioned. 

My qeuestion:

1. Have you had any breach in security of your exchange in the past 5 years of operation? (regardless of minor or a major one). Please be honest.
2. I see that you offer up to 6 different currencies pairing in your exchange, so in the case of decred, why stop at 2? Are you able to make all 6 fiat pairing available on the outset? 
3. Is your $20,000 budget a one time fee to cover all deliverable, namely future maintenance/tech support, or will there be an ongoing charges?
4. Could you elaborate more on the CryptoDealers side of deal? What kind of marketing events, how long will the promotional activities will last?
5. From what i understand, if this proposal goes through, all it takes is 5 working days from start to finish and open for traders to start trading. Is that right?
6. If successfully implemented, will there be any plan for promotional activities on your exchange (i.e: zero fee trading, competition with rewards given based on trading volume, etc etc) to encourage the initial take-up rate? If so, will this be part of this proposal budget?

That's all i can think of at the moment. =)","92454052b7cac9088c6999ee596a7403de774ad6ae3db4deb33a66f77dafcfec4e30b817872aa810d4e42a23fefdd5fb7880c678ffd1610e7319b78ed306bf03","88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","1","7cf0010c3476c8ec4e4e2a9422e4da6b6f79c4643f83767b23108b8d2a6fc40d9d31a38d1c8c9c707ce149ac0b29812f471a249b1bf3e91e8bd52b6782698103",1554223703,0,0,FALSE,NA,"950e8149e594b01c010c1199233ab11e82c9da39174ba375d286dc72bb0a54d7/comments/1",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

**Liked**

* Handling of the [pre-proposal](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/b0y9le/integration_on_exmo_exchange_new_fiat_pairs/) on Reddit.
* I trust DZ's feedback.
* Expansion into new regions and fiat pairs is important.

**Notes**

> quality assets over quantity

I would appreciate if someone could vouch that all [listed](https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/exmo/) assets are quality.

> promo video, YouTube marketing, events

If any promo expenses are included in the proposal I suggest to remove them, focus this proposal on the integration and handle promotion separately (via either separate proposal or via the marketing 2019 budget).

**Concerns**

Social media activity feels artificial. Of course fundamentally what matters is that EXMO provides a decent exchange service to their clients, but still that's a minor concern.

* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/new/). Nice to see so many upvotes for a 6K sub. It suggests much higher engagement compared to our r/decred where 9K subscribers leave 2-4X less upvotes. But why so few comments? For example, [86 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/comments/adudo5/a_place_under_the_new_year_tree_what_to_expect/) and zero comments? The only post with many comments is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EXMO_Official/comments/ad8pxg/how_to_trade_crypto_when_the_market_is_off/edetzk7/), where half the comments are actually criticism and the _only_ account that came to defend is now [suspended](https://www.reddit.com/user/ketschup72/). Now the [poster](https://www.reddit.com/user/ugoyyacjvfrz/) account of that highly upvoted thread is gone, and the thread is delisted from the sub.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com): Content done profesionally, although [begging](https://twitter.com/Exmo_Com/status/1102964806095683584) for medium claps is lame.
* I'm not a fan of [trading contests](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2685) or [facilitating ICOs](https://exmo.com/en/news_view?id=2667).

**Questions**

> EXMO Finance LLP is the largest exchange in Eastern Europe in volume and liquidity.

Is there an independend report to support this claim?

Did all of the listed coins pay the same $24K? For example, did Dash pay for the [listing](https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-on-exmo.8102/)?

> covering losses while adding to the listing (offline for 4 hours)

To be fair, this triggers me. Why Decred should pay for _your_ 4h downtime?

> Technical consultation/ listing support may be requested if needed.

Our dev hours are precious. Since we carefully count all expenses now, will _you_ pay Decred for technical consultation?

What are your thoughts about recent research on fake volume on most exchanges? Does EXMO engage in such activities?

> Verification is not required (trade crypto/crypto)

We have won a couple of rewards such as the best exchanger in CIS 2017 and 2018 (according to the Forklog magazine) Blockchain life and many others, definitely, you can easily google it.**
2. Did all of the listed coins pay the same $24K? For example, did Dash pay for the listing?
**No, our listing fee is way bigger, for DCR as I have mentioned it is only the reimbursement of listing expenses, regarding Dash (we have listed this coin long time ago from the early beginning when it was even Dark coin) or other coins listed on EXMO - unfortunately, information cannot be disclosed.    **
3. To be fair, this triggers me. Why Decred should pay for your 4h downtime?
**It is not a secret that all activities related to listing such as technical integration, platform maintenance, further DCR maintenance, and tech support, others have its cost we have divided this between two partners Decred and EXMO**
4. Our dev hours are precious. Since we carefully count all expenses now, will you pay Decred for technical consultation?
**Unfortunately, no, but if Decred can provide us integration manual for an exchanger we won't take a lot of time from DCR devs **

5. What are your thoughts about recent research on fake volume on most exchanges? Does EXMO engage in such activities?
**I have already provided a link to one of the similar resources, you can compare our trading volume for example with our web site visiting by yourself it is not very hard and make sure that we have an organic volume, the second case, from our latest activities you can watch how we held the first IEO in Eastern Europe – fully organic, 800 participants, 99 seconds**
6. This is great and a serious benefit that is getting rare these days. Perhaps you heard of the ChangeNOW controversy, do your terms allow for something similar to happen? Do you reserve the right to freeze deposited crypto and demand/extort verification?

Lets get this vote across the line in the affirmative.  The demand increase for DCR in Eastern Europe should pay for the cost outlay multiple times over.

It seems you are trying to **take advantage** of DCR's Development fund, especially by asking for $750. 

These types of simple tutorials are generally done by Youtube content creators **for free** (as you did with the 66 other projects) though they get paid by ads, donations, and affilliate marketing so their work is not really for free. I don't see why Decred stakeholders should finance something like this.

As Decred grows in popularity we will _undoubtedly_ see content creators make tutorials covering all aspects of Decred.

Stakeholders should only finance such videos if they are high in production value, something like this:

From my perspective, my detailed walk through videos are much more user-friendly, especially for novice users. These videos will be valuable because a) I will complete a FULL SET of tutorials which will cover the most important topics chosen by the community, b) I will walk people step by step as if they are looking over my shoulder, c) I will help people AVOID specific mistakes they can make in the process like not using a password manager which tends to be overlooked and undiscussed, and d) I will make fresh content for Decred made in 2019. I find it highly relevant to make updated videos since user interfaces change regularly. 

I agree that content creators will undoubtedly make more tutorials covering all different aspects of Decred and many will do them for free. However, since Politeia is big part of Decred, I suspect that these same content creators will pick up on the fact that they can actually get funded to do these videos and will prefer to take the Politeia approach as I am doing. I did the free videos to show my skills and seriousness. The additional videos I’m proposing to do is difficult for me to justify doing for free. I hope that’s understandable. Plus, I am proposing to do these 3 videos in under 1 month versus the unpredictable time it will take for someone else to make free videos on similar subjects which may or may not be as complete as mine. 

Also, I like the video you shared. I’d like to challenge your notion about this type of production being the ONLY type of videos stakeholders finance. My suggestion for stakeholders is to fund all types of video production including documentaries, promo/ informative/ intro videos like the one you referenced, detailed walk throughs like mine, daily or weekly video blogs, interviews, presentations online and in-person, and etc. and not be limited to one style. 

I appreciate the commentary and hope you have a terrific day!","50b9477c380211ef4067d7bd60e86a7c7e9be86cee50af44f297bb79d555c7d2b4764e1abd49fe8d57a264fa90ae241a35b3aab7a0b8724576686ea5c06aa10c","cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","10","cda99895fceec54d1f7e865d2be05f200bc65097bf202f042a2f167455719c9198959b83ff76c9d56be4ea391e4546ee4f6adaa73fae90bf25f6bb36c9ecc403",1550786498,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f/comments/10",NA,NA,12,11,9,NA

To be clear... Yes, I will walk-through how to create a Politeia proposal since it's very easy to do. However, my intention is to go much deeper than that. 

The recent updates for Video #3 state that I will: ""Explain to users step by step how to make a proposal starting with the guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support."" 

Let me know if you think that’s appropriate or not to include in Video #3 or if you think it deserves a separate video. Since Politeia is about proposals in general, I feel like it is appropriate to include in Video #3 because the video will appear too basic without it. 

Because low quality proposals get submitted, my intention for Video #3 is to teach people how to make high-quality proposals in general (not just how to submit one) and create a basic standard on what’s expected. Therefore, Politeia will attract more high-quality proposals along with users who know how to use the entire Politeia user-interface. 

And No, Cryptocurrency.Market will not be mentioned in the videos.","bb6e003da4b1b196f758bd2a826728032d7fa9797aba4ce51ee50e9d116ce763dbdb097787e236af1b0e741cf0ab8f640ef79b28f2e2a188f59387fb863a3a04","cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","13","3b356ced1618b335f624d4497e17502629659dc52316ef079a39d57fbedb7029eb1eef802710d337f542ee0b42eb88d0ff3a538d1cfab7eddd6c9cbe0644ab01",1550795569,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f/comments/13",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

* Ownership transfer of content to Decred.
* Fair budget.
* One revision per video.
* How the author handled criticism and incorporated feedback over multiple iterations.

Concerns:

* Complete beginners may be not the best target for Decred
* The requested budget is low and nice, but I think the cost of collective attention spent on deciding such a small expense is way above the expense. I guess it's okay now because Marketing 2019 is still not approved, so no certainty about its budget. In the future, I think it would be reasonable to include small things into a bigger budget.

Questions:

* Will these tutorials educate people to stop using insecure OS (Windows, Android) or bad habits of keeping funds on exchanges?
* Linked [Decrediton tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rWLI_pC0d4) doesn't include a critical step to ""avoid getting hacked by bad actors"", which is to verify signatures. This is the only way to make sure you get the software unaltered, do you plan to cover it?

The unfortunate reality is that computer security and privacy is a rabbit hole.

On the highest level you develop good habits of attention, discipline and hygiene. You learn to find the right domain, check secure connection, verify sigs, backup seeds and not leave funds on exchange. Also useful are habits to not install random software on the device that stores your keys and generally minimize the amount of code it executes.

Depending on the amount of money in question, at some point it makes sense to also consider an operating system you use. Windows devolved into total anti-privacy garbage in recent editions. OSX looks slightly better, but after multiple incidents like [empty root password](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/7g738d/anyone_can_login_as_root_with_empty_password/) oopsie or the [FaceTime](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/) oopsie, Apple stuff looks questionable. The rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper, down to the Intel spy chips conveniently installed in majority of modern laptops, and finally to horrible architectural CPU bugs present since 90's.

At some point we might have generic [security guides](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/101) that could be useful outside Decred.

I see that your tutorials are targeted at people at the very beginning of the rabbit hole, and helping them to develop even couple good habits would help them avoid most silly losses and be of huge value to the crypto space.","a498060679ac0e9a8ebdff4d057bf620760781047e72d6361165d70ce3e0134e1e2dd489fb0bec620a40fc48bd84b2f2fe5c6e5c49c5832adc0ecaf019c2c307","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","32","6c3da7eaabdde2be7ff5ab7561bc1da9076baf8e07b20eff9edde6dda2b9fe8d3c095b3b54a364c2801c35252242d1ee7b05583d1d075fde496ef5a3cb53d00d",1551365239,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f/comments/32","bee",NA,9,9,8,NA

Re 4th video, if you see good response for first 3 videos, consider drawing from Marketing 2019 budget (if it's approved). I'm sure it can handle these amounts, will be faster and more flexible for everyone, and won't bother stakeholders with another tiny expense. My opinion is that it is better to group small items into big ones. It's up to you eventually.

Thorough security and privacy [education](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/27) is huge, I see potential for a whole series of videos after the introductory 4th video you mentioned.

> I had mentioned in my blog post on the topic, which I will link to in an update to the proposal, that very simple rules could be created to rate-limit trades, e.g. UTXOs used for orders must have not moved for N hours or more to be considered valid. This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known ""dark"" trading patterns. 

If you set N=24 in the above, it would mean that a valid order must be backed by a UTXO that has sat for at least 24 hours.

If you're familiar with spoofing, it is likely a good idea to have some limits on the amount of cancels that be submitted relative to fills.  IIRC, it is typical for fiat financial exchanges to have such limits in place, to keep spoofing under control.","bf78e66b583c35689b7f203dca7210aea0c92820be94eccf6d08c8f4c4f2252b2259a0f5ddc3cd91590404ba4bf02c82f5d689ecc150f5314595dc6b01ce5305","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","7","29dc6e2ac3682e0567f41397720caee606145aa1e43e9d28720adcf69d16aed6c69d6e556114d14e086f3eae479a088f75d4ddbd61243e73063818f515ad9708",1559575693,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a4f2a91c8589b2e5a955798d6c0f4f77f2eec13b62063c5f4102c21913dcaf32/comments/7","jy-p",NA,10,10,8,NA

-Users of Bitcoin ATMs do not speculate by purchasing cryptocurrency through ATMs.. The #1 use case is **money remittance**. You do not need any other cryptocurrency for money remittence other than Bitcoin -- the most liquid and wide accepted cryptocurrency.

-General Bytes is a second-tier BTM manufacturer. Genesis Coin is the clear market leader and most professoinal company. We do not want to integrate only with General Bytes.

-99.9% of BTM volume is BTC... there is hardly any volume in LTC, ZEC, XRP or ETH --> no one is going to buy DCR through an Bitcoin ATM.

-BTM operators are not necessarily going to list DCR on their BTMs when it is unclear whether or not it is a security.

There are barely any in countries that are cash heavy and only 3 in whole of Africa, where people have actually shown inclination towards an quick fiat exchange with no other options.

Now that we have been listed on Vertbase and they are looking to expand in EU, i see very little to gain from getting onto the ATMs which are obviously less convenient option and probably a high risk one due to need of physical presence. Also if they do get any usage (which i am skecptical about) then it will just divert away the liquidity from Vertbase. I think if we can rather show enough volume on Vertbase, that is visible/reported at least as opposed ATM volume which as issac says was not available/reported, then we can make a good case for listing on other exchanges.

Apart from that many people have talked about, (anecdotal evidence from bitcoin) high fees/margins/spreads, privacy infringement via camera and non-working/missing ATMs while being shown on the map, as problems.

I think there is very little to gain from getting listed on ATMs especially at a price point of $10-20K. I would be voting against this proposal unless someone can show some stats about volume and state a case where ATMs will be better than Vertbase. I am assuming that both require KYC.","c77e53f8e9ab7260d1aabc763bfe1f766b4cf445e6559f27dd788fd183367eba946391b79b54c8e388bf80ce3446bf4e0b901f5a1c629eee16cb9b388406c400","8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","21","b158889839cd408ac6f3eca2abd858114bbe0ada6f66181c65b09eba5c2882f8f2f4ad1fef3e58661b936ba662f687902c2eb1decc92e72ba86c50d981b07603",1551026266,0,0,FALSE,NA,"aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d/comments/21",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

I can promise you that building out DCR integration for General Bytes machines is a waste of time.

In addition to the reasons listed in my previous comment, here are several additional key points that voters need to consider:

1) **We are seeing ZERO demand from users of Bitcoin ATMs to purchase Decred. No need to provide something to users when they're not asking for it.**

2) **BTM operators will not list DCR on their GB machines because they don't want to hold inventory. Each operator only has a certain amount of USD-denominated capital to be used as ""float"". They don't want to take any capital away from the BTC float in order to purchase DCR, a coin that is very illiquid and that they do not know anything about.**

3) **Operators are cautious to list coins that have risk of being a security. **While it is believed that DCR will not be a security, the only large-cap coins that we can confidently conclude at not securities are BTC and ETH, and maybe LTC and BCH.

4) The vast majority of General Bytes machines are one-way ""buy only machines"" -- hence operators would need to purchase DCR in order to sell it to users of their GB machines. **Most Bitcoin ATM operators do not have access to DCR markets because there are hardly any DCR/USD pairs.**

**If you want this to pass... NEXT STEPS:**
-Reach out to 1) Genesis Coin and 2) some major US-based BTM operators, such as CoinMe/CoinStar, RockitCoin, CoinSource, PayDepot, etc. --- If Genesis Coin is also on board AND you have the majority of the top 10 BTM operators willing to purchase DCR inventory in order to sell it on their BTMs, then this proposal becomes a little more compelling.

To be clear, _as it stands_, for the benefit of the DCR community, I will be voting ""No"" on this proposal.","ef412d79853aedc6170be623aff91786668d82111e4d3c1dcd29ca3943d84e4d4ac5b0cd4cd88f01a09ab501bb775402411f53e29212bbc89e1bce00617b3f05","d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","28","980b5aa07d6873131b6db471cf44a3ae61421f04a191cea1e4bce79fcf142c250d8a5e5a9b37baaf33455f4615e99c6d4af82b316ac2f14f511948ebeb696d0f",1551383432,0,0,FALSE,NA,"aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d/comments/28",NA,NA,13,11,10,NA

Most of the alts setup, according to management at GB that have been working with us, use preferred exchange backend so there is no inventory for the atm operator.  I believe that is one of the reasons they are growing faster than Genesis Coin and will likely surpass their numbers within 1-2 years.  There would be an option to hold DCR, but apparently a very small percentage of operators on the GB network do this (although this information is not backed up by public data that I was able to find).

Next steps: 
1) I spoke with Genesis Coin numerous times in the last few months and they are not interested in doing an integration.
2) The operators we have spoken to who use GB machines are open to enabling DCR (many of them already have 4 to 6 cryptos on their machines, the open source development at GB with exchange integration and no inventory on machines is supportive of multiple project setups)","41799ccf0cffb09ac19a245b969340a02371e4aad423299b37d491b8d6cc2f3ecef3ff8a6d0435a7ea911328f527d3bfad1f61396f6d1479cc954e46b53ed606","6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","33","12830cf8d749d4c95616c55d1cd15629663c3868773afe1422af4fb1501522211d3debbc51f5e790b921645607288f1357a2b7d48c05e5ab1a7268ec1068f10e",1551940569,0,0,FALSE,NA,"aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d/comments/33",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

My biggest concern with ATMs is handling of personal data.

I'd like to see the privacy aspect clarified as much as possible for those who use ATMs and those who pay for the integration, which is not really covered in this proposal.

ATMs that collect KYC and biometrics contribute to the overall degradation of privacy of a given network/blockchain. More identities attached to addresses and transactions = less privacy for _everyone_. They are even more privacy invasive than exchanges that don't collect biometrics (yet). The collected personal data _will_ be shared with a cannot-be-known list of third parties. Worse, even if they don't share it voluntarily, a ton of companies have demonstrated their inability to secure their systems and lost data of millions of their users to hackers. By default I'm not convinced in any company being able to secure itself and their customers' personal data.

**Questions**

Do all ATMs take photo/video of the user's face?

Can General Bytes or other ATMs do anything without KYC? If yes, in what locations and to what limits?

Do ATM vendors have any commitment to not turn on mandatory KYC/biometric scans for all trades tomorrow? It would be sad to see the integration funded while small KYC-less purchases are possible, only to see it soon turned on for everything.

Do ATM vendors disclose which parties they share personal data with? Do they have any commitment to restrict this set?

Per the ""agreement with one of the recommended exchanges"", do ATM operators forward personal data to the exchange?

Do ATM manufacturer or operators have any commitment/obligation to keep machines running if the Treasury funds some of the work in this or future proposals? Do ATM operators have any obligation to enable DCR support pushed from manufacturer? If no, what do we do if operators refuse to enable DCR?

Who's responsibility would be to maintain Decred support in ATM software, as both it and Decred software evolve?

If there is any maintenance Decred side must do, what is the yearly cost estimate?

Is any control of DCR ATM uptime included in the plan?

Can one sell DCR via those ATMs, or just buy?","4c392b9b3cc2e5360194c05e327aeb924626ce1b7240cb3889767ed7300b7a85e9a5bd2343ac5305a2f4e3ac225f9bd0e46512b7c9ad0d26babe9c2e77233a00","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","37","508509b16244afd8a7b5d7b69044fcdb2069d7c5c7c4a192b84ac8f1d2036eb0826acb7a4df361c822967ac2e9bf2666d1019af3f034941fc385dfb5eeb86306",1553428076,0,0,FALSE,NA,"aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d/comments/37","bee",NA,11,10,9,NA

That makes sense in principle, but afaik, there's no formal mechanism for the community to decide what's ""big enough"" after the fact. So that might need to be defined in the proposal. Perhaps there is some metric that can be used to define big enough? Or, perhaps it's not a binary, but a multiplier? E.g. pay is 40 DCR + A*60 DCR, where A is some measure normalized to btw 0-1?

""Single article"" relationships rarely work out well for the client. 

To provide great results, a PR agency needs to get to know its client very well, and this takes several weeks (like in the case with Ditto PR).

Furthermore, oftentimes when a PR agency sells coverage on a ""per article basis"", this is achieved through deals with journalists that paid to obtain a contributor account.

This frequently results in the story showing in a hidden part of the site (especially the case in Forbes and Huffington Post) where it is never seen by most of the readers of said publication.","16c5f0f293455c815633280f6bc217d5f74e9e8b2b92d16268abdbc1ab0f5575b4e572171c95fa4cf99f89c2fe7e44c39ee2daf0c4ad6897d2ae9b4e68567703","dc61035a02719ea510f10b694fc6bac454ac42c55691d9d2790bb527f91f4d7e","8","705ef6b6674cf61db08a0b20a3dd9baff420f3fe744f833519271db8cc484362be8feebc84b2893d768d842d7ed47b5e635e9f8642d5932f395dbea3a5feb909",1557500383,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/8",NA,NA,16,14,10,NA

You are right that many PR firms do a ""pay for play"" placement model and, I suppose, there's no way to convince/prove that this isn't the  case.

Part of the ""skin in the game"" angle to the proposal was to demonstrate a commitment to the article delivering value to DCR, not just a mention. As I shared above, I acknowledge the rookie mistake of submitting to vote too early before getting enough feedback. Mea culpa and why I will revoke.

I thought that Politeia as an experiment was a story worth telling, which was the motivation for the proposal. The story was to help others see the potential and get motivated to participate b/c of the economic opportunity as well as the mission. 

Given the relatively low cost of this proposal and the performance model I offered, it seemed like a low risk for DCR.

Part of the problem here I think, is that in addition to general resistance to paying for content, as expressed in other comments, Decred has never been, as far as I've seen, particularly focused on engagement metrics. So there's no precedent/formula to reference. Also, content like this is typically produced by existing community members or contractors that are paid in arrears (after the article is delivered). In that arrangement, the project isn't taking on risk that the article is hidden in Forbes somewhere, or that the author will just write one article and leave the project. If you were already a contractor, it is likely you could write this article and bill the Treasury for it, perhaps against the recently approved [marketing budget](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e).","84d6cabbec983f829b3783f75616963b54293e19ca1e76687b4edd4cf96ddf1cf85934b505d26dd9f9bd04839310884f7ae68fd85dd73c1ae3cf8bff909fb608","1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","12","7c45dcc3a9092d9d8db311236f37b53818f3e68082cf0b3648a5bac12a1448e8286b0917e501104a1f9a02ac33d36b8abc3bf3ebe539a5ec41911bb863e5330d",1557636661,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/12","s_ben",0,0,0,0,0

Getting earlier feedback may have spared you some time if you do revoke. However, I will point out that there are people in the project that advocate for having more of this type of conversation here on Politeia, where data isn't hosted on a 3rd party and is cryptographically verifiable. So in a way the content you're writing here is kind of a free meta article about submitting a (possibly) rejected proposal, which they will appreciate; as do I, I think this is actually an interesting idea to explore and am curious to see how it plays out. A larger concern is wasting stakeholders' time when they go to review proposals that are put to vote.

It would be penny-wise and pound-foolish only if Decred is a good fit for you and you decide to pursue those future opportunities. Which you can't find out IMHO until you start to contribute.

I am of the opinion that the Contributor Experience is going to be an important part of the marketing function of any DAO. As in, how easy/difficult is it for new people to get involved and deliver value?

I'm working on a blog post about this and much of it is based upon my book, the Decentralized Marketing Organization, see here: https://bit.ly/whyDMO

One of the reasons why I hope ppl will still vote for this proposal is because I think that, to be an effective contractor for DCR, in particular, it's critical to understand the proverbial ""soup to nuts"" of a Politeia proposal...from inception to delivery.

Your initial comment highlighted a concern about a ""clear lack of understanding of how Politeia is supposed to work.""  

It is my hope that I can gain that understanding by going through the process. But the DCR payment is not just for me to learn how it is supposed to work, it is of measurable ROI to DCR b/c 

1) I will help others understand, through the story of Politeia that I proposed to write, how it is supposed to work so that high quality proposals show up

2) I can highlight/make suggestions of Contributor Experience elements that, perhaps the community will consider should be executed.","494ffe5ccafb7c7c6fe2fe42ed06eff42b051b5bdf9b8ae1a180a6feb2883d1551d92a36879d189026755577115ff0541f1c8bac982ceb4c5ed2357673ba5908","947e2d3d5ed7dfaff737bb90163b46d68d7dafe02c31566184af2c71b224b2e7","14","c9bdea6ac269946a8e3fcaeeb3456df35c82ad39ac6cc8b6f17da639d09995c488e5f3ab32631f094200df39308302c9e017b7b95b9aac1b8460f9c03c153302",1557682662,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/14",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

Given the relatively scarcity of proposals, at the moment, it seems like a waste of stakeholders' time may not be the primary challenge right now, however, it is totally legitimate for down the road.

I guess DCR will benefit no matter what. You are right. Since I am going to write about the experience of submitting a proposal to Politeia and either getting it accepted or rejected.  So, it seems like everyone should just vote against it b/c they will get it for free, right? ;-)

I appreciate your nod to my sincerity and genuine interest in helping the cause. I suppose that is the reason why I would hope the community would vote in favor of it, because it values ppl who do want to genuinely contribute value, took the time to follow the proposal template, etc.  

It makes me think that maybe there's another avenue for would-be contributors...as in ""deliver value first, then get compensated.""

So, for example, let's say my proposal does get rejected. I blog/write an article about it anyway and it generates some traffic, interest, whatever (it would be cool to have a referral link in Decredition that could track downloads stemming from my post).  

Then, I could point to those number and either get tipped or some ""pay per download"" DCR after the fact.

Of course, there's a risk there b/c if I write an article that generates a ton of traffic (for example) and ask for some comp afterwards, the community could always decide to not pay anything.  At the same time, that would certainly dampen my enthusiasm for future work, so there's some cool game theoretics there, right?

Anyway, as you can see, I think about the broad concept of DMO/crypto-CRM (as I like to call it) a lot ;-)

I'm probably going to submit to a vote anyway, because I am curious how this process plays out. I mean, I already paid my .1 DCR (sunk cost fallacy?).

No matter what happens, I'm cool with it, because of what I've learned about Politeia, DCR, the community, and crypto-CRM/DMO.

Jeremy has written intelligently about Decred in the past and has demonstrated a knowledge and interest in the project. He's also been validated by Joel Monegro, who is a trusted member of the Decred community. This is vetting consistent with the DCC process.

He has a proven track record indicating his ability to deliver results on this proposal. The cost associated is quite modest, but more importantly, the story he's proposing to tell is of great value for Decred to communicate. Politeia is uniquely Decred, and it's the mechanism by which we as a community determine what gets funded and what doesn't. The output and the process are both important, and Jeremy's telling of the story of the process could not only get Decred more awareness and reach in a tier 1 publication, it could provide a solid impetus for additional individuals and businesses to join our community.

Furthermore, Decred is short on marketing talent and execution. We're in need of exactly what Jeremy proposes - people to see where they can contribute and jump in! We're a community of doers and Jeremy has already written multiple articles about Decred and now he's proposing this endeavor more formally. 

I think it's consistent with our ideals to vet and qualify as we've done to this point. But let's welcome someone who has contributed already and is attempting to deepen his involvement in Decred.

I feel like you are extremely lucky this proposal was not authorized for voting right away, because I don't see how it could have succeeded. 

The edits you made are valuable though, and more inline to what a proposal should be IMO.

What I'm the most interested in regarding contributors to the Decred ecosystem are people who are actively engaging with the community and who can become more than one-time contractors. This proposal makes it hard to understand if you are merely doing an experiment of using politeia  or if you are genuinely interested in contributing to the project latter on.

Most actual contractors have actually taken the opposite approach : (getting involved with the community first, discussing and contributing and then taking it a step further to become a contractor.) Almost a social equivalent of doing a ""proof of work"".

The cost of this proposal is ""relatively"" low, you have an interesting background and experiences and I may just take a chance and vote yes... still hesitating...,

Regardless of the outcome, if you are interested in the project I would encourage you to get involved  with the community and make yourself known","5b8ad8cd7e891505c8d5db5fef9409af8d40a0ddb382ea3fb73aecaed6530d030e363da822c4033c4a45ad27480c6f1d58a4d32160a435a7012a3c5f83d1ff02","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","20","7a16db8dacf1d6aefeefd02b7517d42a94ba792f7ce3b163eb653994854af482e29439f74333aa05e978fddb6d093b1bc40332b42992758a57d8b1bd59d1c406",1558547303,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/20","nnnko56",NA,15,14,9,NA

It appears that Jeremy has since updated the proposal and had some meaningful interactions with other Politeia users in the comments.  After reading dustorf's comment and the other comments, I have changed my mind on this proposal, which is refreshing.

As dustorf has noted, there is a real shortage of marketing talent and execution in the space, so while there is a concrete cost to this experiment, there is a tangible outcome that could outweigh the cost.  [odin](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/8) does make some fair points regarding the quality of work and the exposure it would bring, based on the approach being taken.  Based on the potential up and down sides, I am of the belief that it is worthwhile to launch this spaghetti and see if it sticks.

There is a notable problem with the proposal, however, which is that it asks for payout in DCR, rather than USD.  I admit that I should have pressed jer979 before putting the proposal up for a vote to change this, and that is my error.  The reason we have contractors bill in USD and get paid out in DCR is that it incentivizes the right behavior: deliver work and get paid at an average monthly exchange rate versus contractors sitting on work until the exchange rate goes up.  Would you be willing to agree to bill in USD, say USD 3,000 for the entire work, with the same 40/60 split on story completion and then publication?","00261c55c7a65718d809c9d01e5b34022172693893573e88e9834c2f13096ede3698e0d95fc4bec7d07ca4254955bc9fa0ce68e36f7d813941eb62256284e705","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","23","72600bb24a86eaed88c83a7f741ddb372fe205a4bd9f9376eca0ca604df7df008abaa72ed980ff5c3baaa8e4e0fec6e40cdf37a99ba5c3f748c0365527925b04",1558615782,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/23","jy-p",NA,12,11,9,NA

local groups in their countries would be much better to address marketing Decred as they would be much more conversant with the nuances of speaking to their audiences

NIgeria , South Africa and Kenya would likely be the best starting point for English , though if we have good french translations of all our information there is a wider swathe of francophone countries to address

GEorgePro's proposal seemed to be a bit expensive and seemed to be a bit opportunistic given his seeming involvement in dash

I would think for the price quoted for jer979's proposal a lot more could be achieved by groups in african countries and if groups would demonstrate some initative and produce some articles that were published in respective news sites then I would be likely to vote yes is they then submitted a proposal similar to this one

if we have not got people involved in decred in African countries , then maybe some research to find crypto groups and try to encourage them to look at decred and then want to market it

NIgeria seems to have a solid Decred group already and maybe they should be tapped for ideas.

Definitely for contractors based in USA, who may be trying to live off of their DCR earnings, I can see that they might want to earn a USD-indexed salary.

However, I'm not sure it would be a good idea to make this a general policy.  

Here are a few edge cases for your consideration:

 -- What if the contractor lives in Tokyo or Geneva, and their cost of living is indexed to Japanese Yen or Swiss Frank and not to USD, and they truly are trying to match their salary with their expenses, to avoid mismatches?

 -- What if a contractor is a superstar, and through one proposal they can double the value of the Decred economy? Shouldn't they be allowed to propose to be paid a DCR lump sum, and if they really deliver a big win for the community, then they can participate in a fully-aligned way in the value they've just created?  

  -- What if in the future a contractor wants to live as a true Decred citizen, earning Decred, running a business within the Decred economy, and spending Decred.  I know it's still a ways around the corner, but wouldn't we generally want to encourage citizens of this new ""digital sovereign"" to index earning, hiring, saving, and spending in DCR terms?

Based on these observations, I would propose that a contractor be permitted to choose if they'd like to be paid out in: 

(a) USD-indexed rate, 

(b) top-10 international fiat currency indexed rate, or 

(c), straight DCR payment if/when that their preference.","a2e0a2cd7a3935564e9b87f4a877e1175c54b5840080f2fa9f86eee8650ec638d7b18a149510a06433fa389cba5ebc031f68a059ddf9546de4f15b4da1f19509","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","28","47606b118ceb7488b03ab9d27302b2adc3d67d7a074996a55031e93cee5b30abef59649aa1e5ff6b758a8477cc48253ecba18ac837ebe419bd5c88b89a322004",1558667336,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/28","betterfuture",NA,11,10,9,NA

He implies in his proposal that both of these publications are Tier 1 publications. which is not true. 



The precedent this sets is saddening. I'm rather disappointed in the Decred electorate, I thought they we were smarter then this kind of bs.

For one, no proposal will double the value of the Decred economy. Barring some miracle (Decred Jesus, are you listening?). You seem to be eluding to paying in arrears (i.e. getting paid only for what you've already done)? That is the way the contractor system works now, but hourly. You're suggesting a performance element. Introducing performance pay is interesting, but presents risk. Especially for marketing tasks. How do you measure the impact of any one action to the ""Decred economy""? In the modern surveillance capitalism model, you can actually measure this for things like e-commerce. But Decred is so privacy-centric it doesn't even track people on their website.

> -- What if in the future a contractor wants to live as a true Decred citizen, earning Decred, running a business within the Decred economy, and spending Decred. I know it's still a ways around the corner, but wouldn't we generally want to encourage citizens of this new ""digital sovereign"" to index earning, hiring, saving, and spending in DCR terms?

While we're still a long way from this for Bitcoin even, the number of merchants does steadily grow. A true die hard could probably survive spending only DCR. This is unrealistic for most contributors for some time though. But something to be encouraged generally.

As for your suggestions for different forms of payment, I agree there is room for experimentation. The current model (USD-indexed rate) has strong support among ""leadership"" and much of the community, because exposing contractors to the volatility of DCR increases their skin-in-the-game, or some such Talebism. I does appear to have the intended effect much of the time, but also ignores the economic realities of many potential contributors, and keeps some good people out.","aa4f9bce530912e76695e78fde5d9240f991c1456fb3ec8ccd3be7d1d62851e3c32d9e54093d7cd3011fc3368f8add7552250db743b089c893fa7ad0cfd0bd01","1690025d33db0ec5cfdb37e7054ed93c1b4327dd394ee7b593034645bd0c59b3","32","a9aef12d2c8235bf37a6d21fe85a40c8525d64830c7b0fc320846f7599bb5f6e363da968a968b3bc66c8d02fdca9c85cc31eff73a16cf9a5d00bf7be2e12f105",1558773326,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/32",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

> For one, no proposal will double the value of the Decred economy.

I understand it is unlikely for a project that is incremental in nature, and focussed on technology enhancement. 

That said, for announcing a successful BD project, it might be attainable.  As an example, when Trusted IoT Alliance announced it would partner with the Quantum blockchain project, the value of the Qtum token economy nearly doubled overnight.  

Lots of times when a small cap company announces an initial major BD deal, the price of the stock will double.  I know DCR is not a stock, but the principle can still apply.

How might this happen for Decred?  What about a proposal from a big systems integration company to integrate a voting app for a particular country's upcoming national election with dcrtime, to time-stamp all of the voting events to Decred's blockchain?

> You're suggesting a performance element. 

In the example above, if the proposal from the systems integration company was to be paid 15,000 DCR lump sum, and the price of the token did double as a result of a successful implementation, it would certainly be a nice reward for the systems integration company to participate in the doubling of the value in USD terms of their 15,000 DCR .  Thus, by being paid in DCR, they are fully aligned with the value they are creating for the economy.  Does that make sense?","72fcf25df8c7a12c029085c4d59366a7f37fa3b212944b89e7ade3305b0e5fd165e3308e385314b9145cd196a6a1ccc0acb6d25943c9a495c201aa8e4e5f030c","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","35","a3c2f6bdc3a3cb74f3fa4368e76e952ecc35bd6d1488d2edab5c492aebbde17f1ed7f99e52666df2aa14e6366b11551c95bbefb8bf46b403a3c85110e34d9d03",1558790562,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/35","betterfuture",NA,9,9,8,NA

Something I have seen while overseeing contractor billing is that things like exchange rates and how those rates are calculated can figure heavily into contractors' behavior.

Billing in DCR creates incentives that do not align well with delivering work in a timely fashion.  If a contractor thinks the exchange rate will go up in the near future and their invoices are denominated in DCR, they are incentivized to sit on their work and not complete it right away.  On the other hand, if the exchange rate is in a downtrend, they are incentivized to hurry and deliver their work product sooner, possibly sacrificing quality in the interest of getting paid out sooner.

Similarly, how exchange rates are calculated matters in the context of incentives.  If you use a spot exchange rate, contractors are incentivized to try to manipulate the exchange rate to receive a better payout, so we use the average of the exchange rate over the entire month a contractor bills for.

From the perspective of avoiding complexity, it does not make sense to accommodate arbitrary payout terms.  The only reason we have been able to build the infrastructure we have is that we have been strategic about adding complexity.  It is incredibly easy to add too much complexity and turn a simple matter, e.g. billing for work, into a rathole.","3e1833148f3fc1dbc45b0839d2864750d744513ff26eafc83f8a2f80abfa542b8fc6629c31f4c80e16e2ca2237274b21ef7b7b67ec9f96cfb6d508b7582c0e00","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","36","67ff3548377bec7a8d1c597d1c79fc5092829f6548268db6c8f89d7fb6d6c7114bd0295451b093dbb5e96b80fe4b23da6275f06a932525663ef0fcbe6f032e04",1558809324,0,0,FALSE,NA,"b9f342a0f917abb7a2ab25d5ed0aca63c06fe6dcc9d09565a9cde3b6fe7e6737/comments/36","jy-p",NA,11,11,8,NA

I saw no reason to publish them because it would, I believed, only make things worse getting into a public discussion about what happened, even though I knew I would have to deal with the legacy of a Reddit hit page on me.

I am sorry you have never heard of VentureBeat.  Within the early adopter tech community, I would make the argument that it's a relatively well respected source and has readers who are more likely than average to explore DCR (either now or in the future).

I don't mean to come off as defensive and apologize if that is the case.  I understand your healthy skepticism and respect it as to the nature/value of this proposal and whether it is the right course of action for DCR, that is cool.

If DCR is to be a currency that ppl use, then it should be thought of as a Unit of Account. The Treasury is measured in DCR so my thinking was that the proposal could be thought of as ""percentage of treasury"" instead of having ppl do a conversion in my head.

It would be cool if a contractor could get paid into a wallet that they controlled, but had ""HODL/stake by default"" so that s/he had to stay aligned for the long-term.

It just struck me as weird to ask for USD when the whole point of DCR is to get ppl to use it. To me, that starts with thinking in terms of DCR as a currency natively.

I would do whatever ppl want in terms of payment, since for me, this is less about the money and more about the opportunity to learn about working with DCR community, evangelize the unique idea of Politeia, and demonstrate some value (hopefully).

You raise a great point:

> This proposal makes it hard to understand if you are merely doing an experiment of using politeia or if you are genuinely interested in contributing to the project latter on.

Can it be both?

I mean...I am doing an experiment which is ""what is it like to write a proposal for a DAO and then have to deliver against it?""

As I hope you can tell from the proposal, the various blog posts, and the engagement here as well as on Twitter, I have already spent time with the community and opened up a number of new areas for exploration (CX, payment in DCR, etc.)  Not that I'm a genius or anything, but there's already been some value delivered merely through how I've approached the process. 

See Luke's tweet, for example:

https://twitter.com/lukebp_/status/1131544948996792320

So, and this was the thrust of the CX post, let's say I put forth a proposal and ppl attack me personally and make me feel like I'm an idiot. Well, that's not a community that I want to be a part of long-term.

At the same time, what if I put forth a proposal and there's a rigorous ""intellectual fight club"" atmosphere through which the proposal gets better, we get to know each other, value is delivered, and ppl are respectful but determined. That IS a community I would like to join.

So, in some respects, the proposal is like a ""date.""  Does DCR like me and do I like DCR...enough so that we want to be long-term partners?

My hypothesis is that, at scale, there will be many, many more ppl like me who say ""hey, I'd like to give DCR a try by making a thoughtful proposal"" and their experience will help shape long-term commitment.

Also, and maybe this is where I slightly disagree with the prevailing community sentiment (which is fine), is that I believe there could be multiple paths towards becoming a valuable contributor as well as multiple paths towards identifying valuable contributors.

After my critical hellfire rant, the approval went down to 57.57%. And now after your diplomatic response your back up to 62.44% approval.

From the proposal I understand, that generally at Bcash a Coin interested has to pay commission to be listed on your ATMs and that Decred will only be added to a limited amount of ATMs. E.g. those currently existing and deployed in the near future, but not on further ones. 

Hence, with this proposal, Decred would:

1. Pay for the implementation
2. Keep paying for maintenance 
3. Pay for being listed on future additional ATMs
4. But not receive a cut of the ATMs earnings

?

It sounds like Decred will pay for a part of your business without receiving a share. 

Besides, I dont like, that this proposal would open a continuous position in Decred's balance (fee for maintenance for the following years), with losing all benefints on cancellation.

It was several years ago, before Bcash's time, so it's possible the following assumption may not apply to Bcash ATMs, but my experience with a different crypto ATM is:

The coins are significantly marked up to begin with, then the ATM takes a trading fee. Couple that with charging the actual coin community a premium for being available on the ATM, and it sounds to me like the ATM owners are trying to dip their feet into as many revenue streams as possible. (Not a bad business plan, but something I don't think serves any benefit to Decred).

I would be curious to hear specific numbers on the markup, fees, specific monthly users, and monthly maintenance costs involved with having DCR available on these ATMs. I know Bcash has no obligation to share this information, but it would help me make a final decision either way.

For DCR, I feel that the only appeal of this proposal is the marketing aspect.

It sounds like Decred will be offered on your own ATMs (15?) and installed on those you sell to other parties in 2019/2020. How many machines do you expect to sell with Decred installed?

In another comment you stated that:
> DCR is not famous in Europe so we need to advertise it by our marketing department (social media staff, salesmen, ATM operators, online advertising, SEO campaigns, media coverage in general).

These costs are not mentioned in the budget. If these are the reasons for the high cost they should probably be described there.

It may be a good idea to consider amending your budget so that payouts relate to performance (metrics that Decred stakeholders will care about) in some way.","5979e22f363beb33922e620b06c4ad16ef2d242189f1b8aab3aa9ac193565abdbb34d1ea80b1c55453b0ab576733845435ece11c551eb9d65d94be3b9b4f9c0a","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","15","9ff6c60b63b7d7cabc6d575b563fe1cdbaaefeca6928e6c9a47f100a2fdd8c45ffde479ba5adfcd65bb57a86e3d2fa8f00c121fec19fc8f41f41b23220b90200",1543504514,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/15","richard-red",NA,11,11,8,NA

I have additional requests for information pending.  My recommendation is that we get more information as a community and take a pragmatic approach to ROI and market penetration.  Note that this information is based on initial emails with marketing managers and verification would be needed before an RFP or new proposal submission.  Based on limited information so far GeneralBytes is a strong ATM contender.  Any community experience with GB or other ATM providers?

Dimitrios and Giannis, I appreciate your effort making the first proposal to the Decred Community and sparking interest in ATMs.  I personally hope you come back with a more competitive proposal as we look for the right solution.","02938edaff5e719aec2fdc920ac23e15a3a75954c12b5f25194de4e7f89db3837089231a69ae350bf3dd615546cab2a9ab71daa4c47bb36b1532a9cc7c04fe0f","6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","22","8cb2302fb8bbb16f7b7162091461c11daa89a03b21d7a29c44231f69e840cc1d03fdfa17eea4359724fdb625c875d2b33897eec89540d6cdaf40f6aa5e00a70e",1543696087,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/22",NA,NA,21,21,8,NA

My understanding is that Decred is open source and that Crypto ATMs charge fees for transactions which go to the proprietor. So if i'm understanding things correctly there should be a minimal internal cost for the ATM proprietor to implement the open source Decred wallet into their ATM infrastructure and then profit from the fees their clients pay when using the ATM. 

Help me to understand why the cost of this should fall on anyone other than the ATM manufacturer.","0174f3ba620fb05851a0b7c01a361e2b36835718b91143226d213deed68b8d1174a2d2fb8d6b17155634500c6b2b470df36e7cf18f3ca72384882ffcba6f280f","8c2b431683ac7d505569d0fffdebda44654a09848b2f035ded81381df812971a","23","351a0048dbc49b724cef3e5576c9d42b214e2c2239928691d1b3dcf2f2810e8020ed43714a9c871664c737a5abd07f3dc7e46e6412de352ad31edb79a12d3f07",1543725059,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/23","somebody_online",NA,9,9,8,NA

> As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

I'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.

Overall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Also, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.

If we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?

// As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.//
 I agree with what @ryanzim posted previously. I'd like to hear what Jake thinks about this? Did you all discuss this before submitting this proposal?

Decred is not a company. The executive team = stakeholders. During development and this transition, the executive contractor is Company 0.

Overall, I'm a bit pessimistic about this proposal. $120,000 for six months seems too expensive. I don't think six months is enough time to develop a good marketing strategy built for the long term. If we decide to try them out, I would go with a trial phase and reduced budget. I'm looking forward to more comments and thoughts for other stakeholders.

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  

We have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. 

The only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. 

The cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. 

I recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally. As our brand equity rises, so too will demand to hodl decred and participate in our governance system.","6591b8e8e79306102e35187989ea3c7545dc99e1035feddb56c51046a7101bf3c0467e87630ea31b7e43772cd289402f8d1afce0cb3f9cb163934e1493bec40e","4ad431a4d546ed1cd631acaf08fa47e41f4e77c45b8057d3cf6ab516f6f284dd","7","4ef45c16f014cc6d60148885b7e4a861c38680df9ba8b1d6dc1a42f2e76e29ccad6d70eb5ce12c86f6e918d9e71beb069ec0c8a426d2207fca1ff7f44888c608",1540084090,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/7",NA,NA,15,15,8,NA

I picked up on a lot of flashy ""marketing"" terms (no surprise there) and I'm always skeptical of marketing services in general. I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive ""brand in a box"" subscription service.

A lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.

I don't think we need to pay for positive media.

Caution must be taken though not to make decred appear like a corporate for profit entity that spends a lot on marketing and tries to attract investors.

I was one DCR team members listening in on the presentation call. My impression with Wachsmans brief presentation was positive, as they focused on quite real practicalities and describing a methodical way of doing things (on PR and Events fronts) rather than attempting to sell the project based on past clients rep. or vague promises. 

As a designer, i'm very considerate about the optics and how different actions effect the reputation of the project. I'm largely in favour of the proposal, as it's mostly sound and proportionate in the ways it relates to these matters. 

Afaik there is not a conflict of interest with their other crypto clients, as there's different employees assigned to these projects, nevertheless this needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts. 

In response to some comments preferring only the current ""grass-roots"" approach and fears around giving off so called ""corporate vibe"" – these cases should not be looked at in a black and white manner. Decred needs a solid PR & events output and professional presence just as much as it needs the friendly enthusiasts and community hotheads. One does not have to conflict the other. I would imagine worse future outcomes if DCR happens to lack on the professional front – as then it simply may not be taken seriously and get the foot through the door when needed. One must not forget, this is a financial product after all. 

To give an illustrated example, quoting one of my past critiques around overusing and turning the spaceman jacket into a bad gimmick if presented wrong context: 
“I am an investor or a person working at relevant business/institution visiting a conference with aim to connect with xyz crypto projects – see a number of professional and respectable looking talkers. Last talk is Decred. I don’t know what Decred is yet. See someone looking like a clown come to the stage. Red flag hits, leave before it starts as the first impression is ruined and i’ve got better things to do.” First impression one won’t get to re-do. 

There are certain marketing and PR approaches that are fundamentally incompatible with DCR imo, for example: deeply sales oriented and high-pressure sales tactics; ""fishsalesmen type"" hype/spam campaigns relying on overpromising, dumbing down; dishonest, misleading or very clickbaity communications for content or campaign advertising, all kind of referral/multi-level marketing schemes. I don't think any of these are present here.

**Media Training + Speaker positioning** 

This service should certainly be focused on. Correct me if i'm wrong, but in the long term DCR will need many topnotch spokespersons rather than relying primarily on Jake and Marco, as neither wish to build images of a central figures. Ideally this service can be leveraged to help train existing community members up, to be better enquipped for the role. Meaning DCR will in the long run have many adept spokespersons. Giving presentations and interviews is simply another skill that can always be improved through work and training. I find it negligible if situation occurs where people who are untrained or with little to no experience end up giving presentations, interviews etc about the project.

**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation**

This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)

Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly. 

Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.

When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.

Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.

This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.

Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to. 

To wrap things up, my questions are: 
- Can you elaborate on this item, your process and the deliverables output for this work? 
- Do you plan on involving more talent to cover this front? 

Thanks.","ed11f934b4e1583f599e0293cc52b9c3a69035c55c2c8a58ef6c2b1c35d6c98d1b4b47a99a4d90c7c1a8fb5090d6aa90210bf8fb4e588db3597b72a989f95508","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","18","25479acadcb07901f0e2bf6e31e3dad347a655c357037fae9e84c102431798f24d0d56a49b37b3e075fafccec228f74b3ab83fe402edec81cb2da98fd0a9e704",1540223542,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/18",NA,NA,15,11,12,NA

Agree wholeheartedly here. The fact that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase isn’t just a major draw for us — it’s a notion that we anticipate will be exceptionally (and justifiably) well-received by the media as well. This is especially true for the more “mainstream” reporters, many of whom will honestly just hang up the phone if they hear “ICO” or “Token Sale.” 

> We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver.

Very, very good call here. This would absolutely be our recommendation as well. 

Wachsman’s goal is never to merely promote hype around a project, it is to demonstrate to the wider blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mainstream communities the inherent value propositions of our clients in a non-hyperbolic way. Wachsman endeavors to act as a megaphone through which Decred’s message can be heard by a greater audience, bringing those with whom this message resonates with into the community. 

>  In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake.
 
While we completely understand the importance of maintaining decentralization, from a media (and events) standpoint we feel that it is exceptionally important for there to be at least one — but likely more depending on the communications vertical — advocate/ambassador that is available and media trained to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors (it is my understanding that we will be doing media training for 6+ individuals, but are more than happy to offer it to more people, as needed). 

This is exceptionally important when it comes to communication verticals like thought leadership/ expert commentary. Wachsman has mainstream reporters reaching out to us daily for quick commentary, and the ability to have an established representative from Decred readily available to turn around initial thoughts on breaking news is hugely beneficial for securing coverage. We anticipate that during our engagement we will work closely with the Decred community as a whole, but in the interest of keeping Decred on people’s radar outside of major announcements, suggest a strong media presence for select team members at least in the immediate future.","4418dfa696e3b15a14ac1d9a2a5833fdf27f3111ee65e09adaa2da25a1adccac25b588e25635eb1193337a9520b6a1bf0443973784d23b8b7996fc9ae7b96408","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","20","a9aa2336fadcca1cc62a61f0a0d151d3ff04a3f68e07cc72827a5b73bfed2ac866ed7ad0d9c8927b0ec70781b52da0f784d476fc4f9464679feb8ecc00a9b90a",1540232829,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/20",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

Wachsman will never pay for media placements for our clients, nor will we deploy advertising budgets. We strongly believe that the best way to generate brand awareness and exposure is through organic media exposure based primarily on the core value propositions of our clients, and the communication of these value propositions to the relevant members of the media in a strategic and measured manner. 

Wachsman are true admirers of the community Decred has built as well as the values on which it was built upon, and we would never tarnish these values by offering Decred a “brand in a box” proposal. What we endeavor to do is to magnify the achievements already made by the Decred community, and the achievements which Decred will undoubtedly make in the future by communiticating them to the world in the correct manner, a manner which is in line with these founding values and the long term goals and ambitions of Decred.

> With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.

This is certainly true to an extent, and congratulations are definitely in order given the project’s success to date. It is our firm belief, however, that given the amazing growth of the project so far - and all the significant milestones to come - Decred deserves a robust expansion of media coverage. What Decred is doing is truly exceptional and you have all worked hard to get here — ** everyone ** should know about it!

Furthermore, it is worth stressing the value of a strategic approach to media, as opposed to one that is merely reactive and ad hoc. There is immense value in controlling your narrative and having news come from you — not just being about you and out of your control. Wachsman has spent years developing unmatched relationships with media (both in trade and mainstream) and as such is uniquely suited to navigate the media landscape, knowing when and which reporters to offer select pitches and announcements to — ultimately striving to have more control over when and what things are said about Decred and how the project is positioned by the media.","e70bd21e5994c60cb67cd472796209d2d78a8f636038e60656ce4388b41c0b706527845e1d84d6670efd1610fa91d50a09b3e32bc5bf9fe5bd3f77ca25e5f302","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","21","af4ea34f93286db0b83c2cb376535a52a51f24955fbc6e2bab68b13d14a112041e77ce00d51fcfcda677911a609d61002ec7f7c9c577d3978b345ab019ba050c",1540233005,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/21",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

While Decred, Dash and Horizen certainly have their differences, in the interest of servicing our clients in an ethical manner, we would (and have) placed a metaphorical wall between them — serving them with different teams and directors on a completely opposite side of the office.","8f5ae67a02dfccbee3d130ccc55b5979e4b207603ec419bd54f03b16ada5c94a729edb1d61130cacbb909325c741c2f3d62788097780417b95d247539de1d60a","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","25","5da453b7e2d21a400ee036b85b7817c30da7862c3b427edf2fdaaf66b10690c70f229bb5686824aed4d6d5ea0d80a192e3030ee0973d573b1a82d93da260c70f",1540233425,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/25",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

Dash core stopped answering questions about DASH development and started becoming more distant and corporate. All communication with the core team was ""filtered"" via and it felt very distant. 

Ironically this alienated a huge portion of the DASH community and hindered the development work. If you want to spend money on advertising, best find / hire someone who is passionate and can explain what DCR does. Maybe some tutorials about staking / voting.","34006faa21b278617f367481525f02a6b2549fcefeb27928bbdf57b8578aac4060324ddbb0ddfa4b582ac8d1d08c4b2dc4e3d03b9b3bae81e96ab44bbf456c06","459b9d7915b5d4c89ac5d7367eede8f3ff29c2a6379faba05bf05879fceaccb0","39","029950a1983df4d498c599827072475cd7dfa2fe0465b875a679fcd230150b0b6a6f26a211704c0d8b04a4ac934d08c89b4bc4e3cca4d1c5ba5f34e6a7b31005",1540319528,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/39",NA,NA,16,15,9,NA

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.

Finally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused. It’s right in our little motto: Strategy, execution, results.","6edd8a0c3242a9fac9120b8bf20c7e19165fa08144133a6eb304f2460dd95f85b4cf0da822293d134a34d2abdbce7feb3417432b4a455b574f97159de7794104","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","40","c6e6b36139a685ed3982aad56bc67f28b328fe3afbd3da8790c3faae321c375d6da6ff795c21cd0b0e7cd53f0f1364f1de5b159e2eecd0a42300eefbfabefc0e",1540322888,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/40",NA,NA,13,10,11,NA

However, my concerns around brand comms strategy work remain. Can you provide any case studies that are relevant specifically in this area of operations and to the described deliverables, rather than journalism related items? I see the two being quite different animals after all. Basically i’m interested in seeing is the sheer creative and intellectual output in a brands own environment, where the tangible work can speak for itself. And this of the suggested copywriter(s)/strategists involved. 

Asking this as I didn’t come across any on your mainsite and only found some external reports that are covering mostly statistics and reach or journalism examples. 

Considering all the work is completely remote, I think there will be a lot of playing-the-phone that will make it difficult to be synced up and most productive. I do consider the copywriter(s) on the task largely responsible for the creative output and assume it would be preferred from Decred team’s end to have them involved closely.","fd427d73622541b5c3dd7ef402455aa53a6926441fabdf314f6b1bc285a5d06bb389e3d2ad25be6dac4042a01fbb805ed58ee5a9a61c88ff532a4ae0d4f6c001","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","41","e7158429702117f6f3a2f10a8565544fdca502dc65a93697311c62708b211c24793f3f1905440cde436eb019c27040af7624c409c6974a08e121d994abc01c04",1540327238,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/41",NA,NA,12,10,10,NA

We have seen time and time again with the company’s coming to us from other firms that it’s the only way you can service blockchain projects. Decred’s representatives, community, and developers are working tirelessly to do all the work you mentioned and more. None of this succeeds if we have to give you more work because we don’t have a big enough or experienced enough or committed enough team in place to service Decred. 
Take our events support for instance — the main reason that we began offering it to clients is because we saw many dedicating a ton of time to navigating the 700 plus crypto events (not to mention hundreds of events we can support you with in other verticals, like mainstream finance or tech) that come into their inboxes a year. With Wachsman, Decred’s representatives and community essentially won’t have to worry about anything related to events coordination other than booking flights and hotels. Speaker pitches, negotiating pricing with organizers, booth set up, even SWAG coordination — we’re taking it off your plate.
The very first thing that Wachsman would do when Decred comes on is have a full kickoff call with the community-chosen representatives of the project (on a conference call that you’re all more than welcome to listen in on). This kickoff call (frankly it’s a brain dump) lets our team get extremely well versed in the project, its timeline, its needs, hopes for positioning in the media, and more. We learn your project inside and out so that we can bring it to reporters and events organizers without needing to go back and forth to your team, slowing down the process and making more work for you. 
Our efforts will always look to highlight the amazing work of your team — not burden it.","9defff8d89de63bbd3f763ce84078c2767e71ce6de5722a4049459c41138f798fde61bd85968813aa0d95e4621578fcf25a0d9db56254f11e03f470c62f40908","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","42","87558cd513415d4fcaa456870eb5ab1874b481ad737f47fc98a903443d98bc90cb63355f2f25257cfb6b5f04b2903a2162b4a52509ed9af37c4c21cd5537db09",1540393293,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/42",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

- Track record and Blockchain experience

- Team credential and depth

- Global footprint (Asia presence is key)

While you're right in that I cannot list specific KPI's (i.e ""we'll get Decred in Forbes this week""), I can point to our proven track record of lasting and impactful success (both over the course of full campaigns and recently -- its a lot harder to get coverage now than it was six months ago, and we are still getting amazing results every day) as an indicator of what your investment might translate to in terms of output.

Generally, is there any funding that may be required from Decred on top of this proposal's budget? If so, do you have an estimate?

> Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

Interesting, I'd love to understand this better. Say we have an incident, like a 12 hour network stall, or a serious vulnerability discovered. What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples? Looking at your connections, do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery? Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability. Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal? Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing? Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts? Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work? Will you publish post-event analyses publicly? List of clients in the portfolio is impressive but only contains short descriptions of clients. Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? Like a simple per-client list of actions taken, with some result analysis. linnutee asked a similar question with no reply so far. How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing? Why some of the linked articles feature Blockfolio and Ethereum while they are not in the list of clients? Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'? Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid) Are the payments monthly? Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Or, alternatively, slowly ramp up the expenses based on deliverables. Asked a few times but answer so far. In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred? Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public? In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto? linnutee mentioned legal contracts, which contracts and with whom will be made?

On the text itself:

1. Please avoid using tracking bits in the links, e.g. `#1716b3851e51` in the forbes.com link or the `utm_xxx` in coindesk.com links. Anti-privacy tracking links are bad in general, but are even worse for a site that is visited by stakeholders.
2. `11.01.18 — 05.01.19`: please use international date format, month before day is [US-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country). By the way a good PR direction is to make Decred look less US-centric.

Signing with Wachsman means Decred does not have to worry about hiring an events team - we would cover you across the board from screening events, applying for speaking opportunities for your chosen representatives, helping with booth set up and ordering SWAG and more. The only thing Decred would have to worry about would be paying for the flights, hotel rooms, and tickets to the events themselves (although we are extremely good at securing discounts). For Decred specific events (hackathons, roadshows, etc.) we offer full support there as well.

> If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

Ideally Jake would be one of many representatives - based on their area of expertise (i.e. a lead developer to talk to developer press). In a perfect world, a decentralized project wouldn’t have any centralized spokespeople - but in the current media and events landscape, they would be needed to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors. That said, Wachsman would work extremely hard to protect the decentralized nature of Decred -- it’s one of your best selling points and speaks to the very reason this industry was started in the first space! We would do this by working very closely with the community.

> What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?

There would be two main buckets here that would fall under our “rapid-response” engagement. 1. Manage, contain, and minimize negative publicity related to Decred, while developing a crisis strategy, contingency plan, and pre-approved drawer statements to prevent and mitigate any potential future crises. 2. Generate ongoing and regular content to strategically pitch Decred to media to ladder down negative articles about the network stall in organic searches. When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this) examples of crises that Wachsman is prepared to help mitigate include: platform/token hacks, regulatory intervention, subpoena requests, unfulfilled company promises, staff departures, technology flaws, investor withdrawals, token offering extensions, sharp declines in token value, social media account takeovers, security breaches, and consistent community/developer/media criticisms.

> Do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?

You can be the best project in the industry and be excluded from the media landscape entirely without the right team in place to change that. The bar for coverage in CoinDesk (a Wachsman client) has risen significantly in recent months - but we’re well prepared to navigate that (including suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo). 

> Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.

Agreed 100 percent on the value of growing a developer base and there are several levers we can pull there. 1. A tailored media campaign to the publications we know developers are more likely to read. 2. A tailored events campaign to get Decred at the events we know developers are going to (including ones with job fairs) and supporting Decred in rolling out their own organic events - like hackathons for example. 3. Leveraging Wachsman’s Strategic Advisory Group that does this all the time. We didn’t list them in the day-to-day team members that will be supporting Decred because we didn’t want to misrepresent who will be supporting Decred daily, but this is an area that they would be well suited to help you with. As a bit of a background on them, they are headed up by Michael Chang and Franklin Bi. Michael previously served as Senior Vice President at Jefferies investment bank where he led the blockchain coverage effort. Prior to joining Wachsman, Franklin led the Blockchain Strategy group at JP Morgan. He helped lead the Quorum initiative and co-founded the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, among many other achievements. 

> Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?

One of the biggest focuses in hiring in our Singapore office has been fluency in other languages. While we focus primarily on English speaking media, we are well (and uniquely) suited to pitch Decred in other languages - we would likely rely on translation services for full releases however. 

> Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?

Yes, absolutely. Decred’s community is one of the most important pillars of the project - we would look to include it across the board throughout this campaign. 

> Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?

While (hopefully) this would not be part of our day to day activities, we would leverage our rapid response and crisis communications team to guide Decred through instances like this. 

> Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?

That’s a fantastic idea and certainly something we could look to do in the interest of keeping Decred’s community members as involved as possible. 

> Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?

Yes; happy to. 

> Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? 

There is more info [attached in this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11v242zQ3bhj3aDaoKM7ZsrKexRIsqwA4Aez4mzXnQAw/edit#slide=id.g46600410e6_0_0) that goes into a bit more detail the nature of our campaigns. Happy to elaborate on any specific use cases. 

> How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?

In terms of the linked articles, Wachsman focuses entirely on “earned media” meaning we leveraged our relationships with reporters and industry knowledge to generate pitches that we then presented to individual reporters based on their interests who then generated organic content of their own based on it.","2f3417508e5816f5238b6181028ee2ecf124b55306106c992bab775d37a018d98bc883f4d9d5935dbf368050c9a034730bfdc25ac5c5429bd33169828fcded0b","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","70","118262eae35780fd360c095fa554e862e34c5361414615fc422c25f6e92bbbb9eada2a7cab0126b0db84420566addd813396a0bcae7c899250bad15686b4aa0a",1540912904,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/70",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

These would fall under the idea of “expert commentary” -- leveraging industry trends or larger stories to insert commentary that further establishes Decred’s chosen representatives as wider industry experts -- not just Decred experts. This both keeps Decred regularly in the news and further establishes your representatives/Decred as one of the best and most experienced teams in the industry. 

> Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)

No, we have not. 

> Are the payments monthly?

Yes, they would be monthly.

> Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? 

Yes, we have a standard 30 day out clause specifically to ensure stakeholders remain in control there. Frankly though, I would be shocked if you chose to use that clause. 

> In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?

Yes, absolutely - that would be supported by the aforementioned Strategic Advisory Group. 

> Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?

Not to my knowledge, but we would be supportive of the idea of doing so for all future calls in the interest of keeping Decred's community as informed as possible. 

> In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?

Wachsman has worked with other PR firms in the past when our offerings were complimentary - working with a firm that focuses exclusively on Korean speaking media or reporters in the art vertical for example. In terms of working with another firm in the same space, I would have to echo Ditto's thoughts there - it would likely be redundant.

> When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this)

I think here you mean carrying communication with other clients to not make Decred look bad. That's reasonable.

I'd only like to note that I see no problem talking about incidents in public. The 12 hour example was made up, but we had a real 9 hour stall recently. As seen [here](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=127080&rows=40), block 127072 was mined 9 hours after its parent. It was due to a sudden spike in hashrate, which is a good thing. Delayed transactions are not cool, but they were the only problem. All core software behaved as expected.

Cryptocurrencies do have incidents, post-mortems are openly published, and personally I find them as a good way to know the projects better by watching how their teams react. For example, the [report](https://www.dash.org/2017/03/08/DDoSReport.html) of the DoS attack on DASH left a good impression: the issue was handled rather fast, a report was posted, and a message saying ""there are people out there monitoring all the time"" conveyed.

> suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo

Embargo?

> Can you elaborate on this question? (legal contracts)

Sorry this is me still wrapping my head around some aspects of Politeia. When discussing conflicts of interest, linnutee suggested that separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts"".

Correct, a lot of crisis communications includes minimizing coverage of the story as much as possible - or at the very least getting ahead of it so that when incidents do go public, like the DoS attack on DASH, we can control the narrative around those incidinents. Part of that minimizing coverage as much as possible means that we would do our best to prevent it from being brought up again at a later date — and as such wouldn't use it in public discussions down the line. 

> Embargo?

A lot of mainstream reporters — particularly those in this industry — won't go near news that has already been ""broken,"" meaning if a story about Politeia going live has already been picked up by a number of the smaller trade outlets, they won't go near them. With stories of this nature, Wachsman would bring the news to a very selected (and trusted) number of reporters in the space that we know will not break the story early. This allows major reporters to do their dilligence, have interviews with relevant parties, and fold coverage into their own editorial calendars ahead of us distributing the news far and wide at a pre-selected date. An example of this was eToro's launch into the United States. The Wachsman PR and Events teams worked for several weeks under embargo with top-tier reporters so that when Yoni Assia was on stage at Consensus announcing that they were launching in the American crypto market, several top tier articles went live at the exact same time.

> Separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts

Not a problem. Wachsman would sign a contract with the entity chosen by Decred's stakeholders to represent Decred in contract signings such as this.","e53844ec5799f9a935a65a101aa3e18020950e9722a0c99348d983ebec27272a6c69ef0bfc9c83415d2e6d5bdaf87e7bcfbfc9cde4ee2566052fd8e8e7fa1906","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","73","7f23586fc8b072a7a38a8c95765460cb1e11f7bc90a00385c648b2e5c8c9d9ed2f2024968b74fe8d8953d50999afd0c92031bb6aa9d0621520416c6fd3221404",1541079801,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/73",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

My perspective on what constitutes a good research outcome (which can probably be quite well inferred based on my [medium](https://medium.com/@richardred) and [github](https://github.com/RichardRed0x) accounts) may not be the same as yours, or some segment(s) of the stakeholder community.

That's why I think this could benefit from being plugged into Politeia in some way. We'll find out more in the next few days or weeks about whether Politeia comments and up/down voting scores carry strong signal from the stakeholder community.

In terms of putting this program into practice if it is approved, I am thinking about another Politeia proposal which is not intended to go for a ticket vote but instead is used for collecting comments about research ideas and using up/down voting to indicate preferences for and against pursuing them. A channel on Matrix/Slack specifically for this where interested people can congregate would probably also be good.","3c7c589bd86da23588229ea9e470c200471ae685c7777cb5258cda05c2b028deccd647caaf1a5b168a42fe948f5f0bd4f79060dff4405048060c348469d95f0d","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","5","c397e0af17bb6472efc653adf2bccbfbbf016f0121148d4f5b2769eb5233910ad5aa3b602420a3cad1d0f877f72a596541691dc11de79d671b87a7637ef48e0d",1539703010,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/5","richard-red",NA,9,9,8,NA

1. Community votes on the idea and write-up.

1. That depends on one's epistemological perspective I guess, along with the specific research question and methods. The purpose of collecting data and sharing it openly along with the analysis is to allow people to reproduce it and test alternative hypotheses. 
2. In my view the second proposal will be this opportunity. If I fell like this is going badly I will not make a second proposal and may end this first one before the budget is spent. Stakeholders will vote to decide if it should be an ongoing program by approving or rejecting the second proposal. I think that's about the right level for stakeholder approval of the program as a whole.
3. I'm not sure that estimating the total number of hours to be worked is going to help with estimating how many questions can be covered. That depends on the difficulty of the question and how deep the answer goes. The program will require a way for stakeholders to feed back on the quality of specific pieces of work though, I will try to add something about that.
4. I am very interested in exploring ways in which payments to contributors could be tied to quality of work product.

2. This has been addressed in my [recent blog entry](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/).  As monthly invoices are rolled up into a monthly payout, there is an auditing process.  If contractors are found to be billing large amounts without corresponding public deliverables, they are asked about their work, and can potentially have their invoice payment delayed.  This will become more automated over the next few months with the contractor management system.  Asking stakeholders to judge the quality of particular research strikes me as a bad idea because they don't necessarily possess the domain knowledge to judge the quality of that research, the same way most stakeholders are not in a position to judge code quality.

3. Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc.  Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved.

4. Bounties create a number of problems in the context of research, e.g. 2 people working on the same bounty, 1 gets the bounty, and the other has spent potentially substantial energy duplicating the other's work.  Bounties work well for things like software bugs, but even in a context  where it works well, it takes a lot of effort to manage such a bounty program.","be9f38dbf36dedf0b8233138e21091fa322148168fb78c5543234f40b4e4c55acc4f36833b622bf69f069932c325d0648dffad1f092936619cdbe5f7ec5dd40a","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","18","a568eb51dd086c5e14e2563b0b546454718e771cad897cc78e325487bbcff911b8ee9b7d17375d6481524e461b45cb96bb6826d0d2e4ce81a54e18d77982db0b",1539885820,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/18","jy-p",NA,12,10,10,NA

So why don't we skip the public vote and appoint a board of accomplished developers like other academic institutions? The conundrum here is involving the _stakeholders_ in providing consensus to the allocation of _stakeholder_ funds. After all, Decred isn't a privately funded university.

I see Decred in a space that is highly experimental and exploring new territories, I see this as something akin to the ""Business Intelligence"" side of Decred, but it is also much more. An initiative like this can grant foresight through analysis, that will help evolve the project in a way that has strong intellectual foundations. 

Why I support this:

	- Provide data that the community can leverage for collective intelligence and ultimately informed decision making
	
Some areas of research areas relevant to Decred can be:
1	How to increase antifragility and protect agaisnt consensus failures or majority attacks.
2 	Gini coefficient, and state of decentralization.
3	Privacy Research, to what extent should privacy be implemented, does it contradict or clash nation state laws.
4	DAE applicable research like, contractor rates of pay, how to pay fairly and audit in a manner that does not remove autonomy.
5	Policies to enforce in the event of misbehaving miners.
	
These are just some examples of areas and not formulated research questions. I believe foresight is key to Decred and  uninformed and preconceived notion will be pushed around everywhere.

Specifically, from someone who is not close to the decred developers/contractors and their processes. I didn't know that most contractors start with a 12 hour week billing cap, for example. Thank you for that information, that's helpful and an example of what I wanted to learn from my inquiry. From looking at another comment, I also glean the following information - ""Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc. Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved."" If there is some kind of standard decred contractor process that will be followed, I'm not aware of any public documentation that outlines those details. If a standard decred contractor process is to be followed, that should be noted and documentation should be linked in proposal.

My questions still stand, that I would like to see a more detailed breakout of how the funds are budgeted (even if just napkin math with assumptions) before approving the proposal when it goes to voting. I don't have a lot of confidence in ""$10,000 should last a few months"" just at face value.

An example of what I'm looking for would be (given the new information provided since the original proposal):

**Budget**

_Assuming 4 new contractors would be brought on for this project with the introductory billing cap and billrate, the project has funding for ten weeks._

**_4 new contractors x 12 hours/week billing cap x 20 USD/hour x 10 weeks = $9,600]_**

This also provides transparency and accountability in the case billing were to vastly differ from a proposal budget. What assumptions were missed and by how much?

Great power hides behind this proposal. Sophisticated intelligence can help us make much better decisions. Someone knowledgeable could share the numbers, but I bet nation states spend a ton of money on intelligence.

After reading the prop for the first times I felt it is too abstract and that I don't fully understand what work will be done, so I see why people might be confused. Adding more examples of work would benefit this proposal. So I started writing down ideas for a few days.

## Existing work

First I realized that some in the spirit of this proposal _already happens_:

* [Politeia Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qnye8/politeia_digest_issue_1_a_short_weekly_update_on/)
* [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/)
* [@zubairzia's articles](https://medium.com/@zubairzia)
* [@permabullnino's articles](https://medium.com/@permabullnino)
* the [list of exchanges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/) supporting Decred, maintained by snr01 (has many exchanges not listed by coinmarketcap!)
* the new [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) repository
* please share any others you know

As zubairzia0 noted, this could be so much more. Wait for it...

## Decred Intelligence Group (DIG)

First I called it Decred Intelligence Agency (DIA), but DIG sounds more fun, right?

Below are some research ideas:

* Expand the [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) into more thorough ongoing monitoring project that would track articles on all languages, and possibly track videos and podcasts mentionin Decred. Then add additional datasets with subjective metrics like quality.
* Ask @permabullnino (Twitter [@ImacallyouJawdy](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy)) if he has any studies planned.
* Collect and organize info about services that support Decred. Services like exchanges, wallets, payment processors and such. Dig their backgrounds, try to see which are trustworthy and reliable. This also includes actually testing them. People do it already in #marketing before announcing integrations, but I see opportunities for this process to become more organized, involve more people and produce more knowledge. snr01 has a nice spreadsheet already, and I have some drafts on this.
* Track how ratings agencies rank Decred and maybe try to educate them.
* Write tools to automatically detect new first time contributors (I need this for the Journal)
* The definitive index of community discussions. Something similar to Community Discussions section in the Journal, but as a separate project with more frequent updates and wider coverage.
* An archive of event reports.

Then there are opportunities for more deep research that might have strategic value:

* Study the pain points of running Decred full nodes to get more people to run them.
* Track which projects build on Decred or btcsuite codebase. This can be useful for marketing, recruiting and harvesting upgrades for the codebase.
* Find and connect with communities that might be interested in Decred's mission, e.g. local open source hacker communities. This effort can collaborate with marketing people and benefit marketing and recruiting.
* Watch projects active in the governance space and learn from their experience. Maintain a list/analysis of projects, tech and ideas relevant to the governance sub-domain. Compare them to Decred, see if Decred could incorporate anything good.
* Analyze narrative in social media for a given subject. Example: this year there was a lot of criticism of on-chain governance and coin voting from prominent Ethereum contributors. As we figured, their criticism applies quite well to Ethereum but not so well to ""money only"" project like Decred.
* Monitor and analyze criticism, trolling and info attacks on social media. There were several cases when a few previously unknown Reddit accounts showed up and furiously attacked some aspects of Decred, representing themselves as parts of larger offended group (e.g. poorly handled contractors) and painting things in too dramatic ways. This is potentially damanging to Decred project and ideally should be detected and revealed to the community as quickly as possible. This could involve timing and linguistic analysis of messages. I did a few of such analyses for r/decred manually and I can say it consumes a lot of time.
* Analyze general social media sentiment towards Decred. This could involve going as far as automation with sophisticated crawlers and machine learning. Could be a collaboration with teams that already work in this domain, e.g. [BittsAnalytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7vqaty/nice_sentiment_uptick_on_decred_based_on_our/).

Finally, there are some interesting topics I would like to see researched but they require expertise in fields like programming or legal knowledge, while some can be only done by the developers. Still, let's not them for completeness:

* Some areas of research that zubairzia0 noted.
* Collect interesting stats from the blockchain (see a few examples in the Network stats [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/2), but this will move soon).
* Stats from social media.
* What legal and tax status does Decred staking have in different countries?
* Watch the space of open hardware, look out for any devices to more securely run Decred. Perhaps even fund some (many have very nobel goals but suffer to get funded).
* Watch the topic of ASIC resistance and analyze interesting events.
* Watch the development of Lightning Network and produce short updates specifically targeted at Decred stakeholders.
* Why we should feel safe using Go, which is influenced by Google.

Regarding concerns about money waste: continued payouts are a good incentive to impress stakeholders with good intel so that they keep funding this project.","fd69a58cd1b1944147662a48a13727325e9558258bdb7c7b7eeb1cd65b6376f383455b4507462971ed9f8a14b0a013e6f0ff94a8b161eabd934b958550b96c08","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","32","e47e2728e481f4f98230b95e6322eac5a5e9ddbccfe50beffa1a85b0236397d559d531467414825989af9bfe6c0550e14c2eb76efe910c7db744d5dcf882510e",1540681713,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/32","bee",NA,13,13,8,NA

I agree that work in the spirit of this proposal already happens (and count some of my own among it, like my analyses of the [Dash treasury](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/dash-analysis/tree/master)). 

It is not my intention that _all_ research work for Decred should have to go through this proposal. Anyone is free to take on some work they see value in and submit it for review in the usual way.

One of my aims with this proposal is about developing methods for the community to signal which research projects they see value in - so that people who do not have confidence in their read of what the community values can sidestep that issue and work on research projects that the community has signaled support for. Or, add their own ideas into the mix and see if the community sees value in them.

I like some of your ideas, and I like some of @zubairzia's ideas, but there are others I am lukewarm about. I don't see it as my place to decide whether each of those ideas are worthwhile or not. I think it would be sub-optimal to maintain a huge list of every research idea that a community member shares and say that we'll pay for work on any of those. Some have more value than others, and we should be encouraging people to work on the more useful projects, once we figure out what they are.

The other main aim of this proposal as I see it is to develop a more collaborative environment for conducting research, along with embedding standard practices of sharing data and analysis methods/code, so that the research is more replicable.","3a5a75e1db40d5569b89a22dc5aa0f219b5f227abd0a08b90903a60fc3d22cb93b083272af6bae2bc044dea74a43473ed59a71f7b3a005673f40e3cae3edac04","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","33","0148bd5fb102f53e49ea90e96d2e17a619c6c6bd522f798c13c20f1b0dc42019ad496463f48cf2dc3c537a267b747d0433dec969da70d7636347d3a9b5dad00e",1540686290,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/33","richard-red",NA,10,10,8,NA

For clarity, this vote is currently for a 220000 USD equivalent in DCR budget for planned activities and 70000 for potential new activities, and would operate as a budget (where only actual cost/hrs are paid for activities and there is shared responsibility to end the year at or below the target budget)?  For example, if only 10 of the 20 suggested community members get local events rolling we might expect the end of year spending to come in at approximately 50,000 USD for that line item rather than 100,000?

Here are my three specific issues with this proposal which would make me vote against this. 

a) $65000 is a very expensive for the amount of work speced out without much clarity on actual payrates. 

b) Community Organization plan for $100,000 without any small scale experimentation looks very suspect. This should be started small and proven. Better still, teams should approach decred directly without going through gatekeepers. Giving this budget to one person means creating unnecessary power centres and should be avoided at all costs. 

b) $70,000 in funds for an unspecified cause is a complete no-go for me. You should let the treasury decide this, otherwise what is the whole point of pi?

a) It looks like you have made the manual process unfriendly for independent contractors. There is no dearth of contractors willing to work provided the system gives them the chance.

Dash pays contractors upfront via blockchain- while this may not be the best way it certainly ensures an open, encouraging and democratic system. 

b) Because of a) we are going to be forced to handover large funds to one or two core team members which is a pretty limited pool to select from and smacks of centralization. This would in due course lead to price gouging.

I think we must keep in mind that decentralization will not happen instantly and it was never expected to. Most of the elements we see in this proposal are for types of work that are already being done and for which funding was allowed from the treasury by the DHG during the last 3 years.

I don't believe either that this proposal is the ""final level"" of decentralization that we hope to achieve. This proposal is however a clear shift in transparency and an important transition from the DHG management of the treasury. The key word here being ""transition"".

I also have a few concerns regarding the content of this proposal, although I understand the complexity of shifting how funding is managed and the implications for people already in place and currently at work.

From my experience when you have people who do excellent work, are productive and autonomous in your team, the last thing you want is to micro-manage them. Rather, you want to trust them and let them strive for greatness because that's when you get the most out of them. 

My first concern is on the timeframe of a full year, I would hope we eventually turn to more frequent and standard periods (like quarterly) for most stakeholder's budget approvals. I say most,  because there are a few domains where annual review would certainly be enough and make more sense. As we are in uncharted territory here, a year long period is a safer, although slower transition IMO.

My second concern is regarding the grouping of multiple elements in the same proposal. It does make sense for a marketing plan as a whole, but it does open the door to having more difficult votes if some elements are more ""controversial"" than others or if stakeholder see less benefits in an item.

For example: To me the Decred Assembly, Newsletter, Website updates, Podcasts, and Internship are no-brainers and budgets are within what we would expect of quality content for these types of work. For the other elements however, it's a lot harder for stakeholders to decide if budget is adequate and to envision what actual work will be done. I would be much more comfortable with a shorter timeframe for these elements.

As a side note, I could see future proposals presenting a year-ahead plan and budget like this, but requesting ~quarterly payments in follow-up proposals where stakeholders can evaluate progress and actual spending. That would most probably alleviate my concerns, and leave room to adjustments if needed, while keeping a way for increasing/lowering budgets or adding/removing elements, if conditions change during the year.","d1a1e96fd8e825de8c53290117085c84d798b97b40a506acab70bd2870b6f79e8000f73d658ae52bd02a205853424f90dc9a4a7f388fe4fc6a88a2f1090b0f0f","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","13","4648096edb9d02544f6edf1e1dfe3865763632952788b7b9ae03cc0c07bdacc76036b69f3d0f53aa75bb650fc0918d27b0b2acc7f0be128009df272fbab0a808",1550896526,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/13","nnnko56",NA,21,20,9,NA

If I'm wrong someone can correct me,  but this proposal would not hand over the total amount to an individual or put someone in a deciding position.  It's the exact opposite....

My understanding,  is that all work described in this proposal,  would be billed at an hourly rate by each community member to the upcoming DCC platform.  (Instead of the DHG). In the DCC platform, contractors in all fields, review work being done by their peers before payment is made. The goal is to eventually see all those steps including payment, automated, with no manual intervention in the treasury from the DHG.

This change explicitly remove gatekeepers to the treasury while giving autonomy to contractors, and ensuring peer review of every little detail being worked on (without involving stakeholders in micro-management of daily hours).

This method is a clear step towards removing individuals from power position, and having the collective stakeholders and contractors, manage this decentralized organization efficiently. It will definitely be harder and (eventually impossible) for someone to ""run with the money""  after those changes, than it was in the last 3 years.

Also, as all work need to be billed to the DCC, costs represents the total budget cap allowed by stakeholders and not the actual payment directly given to each person involved. If the work done and validated by peers on the website, end up to 40K$ at the end of the year,  nobody will have the possibility of leaving away with the remaining 25K$. Work still need  to be billed to the DCC and reviewed by peers before any payment goes out.

All parts of the puzzle may not be in place yet,  but I believe it's where we're going. Am I right ?","ff0d2c58ad95ba4fd3fb1bb6acd7346c7b3eef3e561873dd3683736b8c79344a06d6ac11938363cef3d18640f31288cd26a5b0daf945d563d6a6234c00d02003","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","15","507e054dbd110e4ee6518a583cb6c9d3986a6994e0fd84c296e43bfc4663628f8ae860aa148469881460522baef4827a28ab4a051ea318ca1322b454af309403",1550925775,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/15","nnnko56",NA,11,10,9,NA

I think the key thing here is people should see these proposal as moving away from DHG to multiple contributors who manage different domains like marketing, events, development, research etc. I think that for future these types of proposals should be presented as ""Proposal for Marketing Management for 2019"", as this is clearly what it is.

We have seen a natural hierarchy develop in most areas where some people are more dedicated, experienced and talented and eventually start co-ordinating activities and other contributors seem happy to look up to them for guidance and advice. Some examples are bee(data management/information gathering), dustorf(Marketing), richardred(Research), davecgh(cryptocurrency fundamentals/programming & education). I think this is decentralization at work, devolving power away from one entity (c0/DHG) to multiple individual/corporate contractors.

It is exciting to see new people come in and fill the gaps. I think although people will balk at the term middle management but that is what has emerged naturally over time and we should probably formalize it with such transparent proposals.

At the very least, each section should have a further breakdown on costs. 
This should be a rule for Politeia. For instance. 3.5k per Decred Assembly. How much goes to the studio? If the figure is above 2k, understandable. If it is less than 2k, probably not. The point is you have to be completely transparent and not vague.

The same goes for the website and supplementary. 65k and 70k.
Looking at supplementary, how much per each person/contributor? The same for the website? Can you be more specific? How do we know this will be spent responsibly if it is this vague.

I don't think it's appropriate to share my wage, as that's an invasion of my privacy and it will not be shared under the DCC format. I will say that my wage is a fraction of what i would be paid if I worked for a corporation, and like many contractors, I'm billing for fewer hours than I work. Additionally, I was part of the project for many months before receiving compensation of any kind, and only received it after jy-p instructed me it was time. 

My first contribution to the project was a user survey (shared in chat last May), which coincided with a key stakeholder survey and competitive analysis. This yielded a positioning strategy, which lead to the process of finding and vetting a PR firm, which [I detailed in this extensive blog](https://medium.com/decred/pr-in-politeia-process-progress-and-pitching-in-d88771183dd4). I then hashed out the messaging, seen [here](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV), and I have been managing the PR engagement, which has seen Decred be prominently featured in Forbes, Fortune, Breaker Mag, Coindesk, and more. I've been managing events for some time, I've developed this plan, and I am eager to get started provided stakeholders approval.","4e3a22a43517c5a7f8a29c3bd95aed60998f72515f3a2392db5d9ee475b305205c391c8c1766cce7b0ddc1a501481c6e3dfd2b200d1dba0a982f9f1892c7b50d","2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","36","a6a6538756f308bc8fb279afad4d7dce0cdd73dcfd7f6da4573dae2aeb5db357c7859a7fdbbdf3b47c6e8b4d26b3c649ab85ea96b14c638989217d3dfc87f600",1551198075,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/36",NA,NA,18,15,11,NA

Regardless of whether you agree or not with the proposal, please consider these points regarding the payment process of contractors following a proposal. (I've made some effort to dig up this information and confirm my understanding of how things works. The chat can be seen in the #proposals channel on matrix/slack). It was also agreed that the information is not readily available atm, as we are switching to the contractor management platform.

- This is not a proposal where the full amount is to be paid to the author like smaller proposals we had before.
- The author will not personally manage payment to sub-contractors from the requested amount.
- All work being done in the context of this proposal (including the author's time and contributions), will be billed in the form of an invoice to the contractor management platform)
- Work billed to the contractor management platform is reviewed by peers (other contractors in the same domain. i.e: coders review work by coders, etc..)
- Work is paid in arrears only, after review by peers.
- No payment can be made from the treasury with no reviewed work regardless of if there is budget left from the initial request.


The process described here is so that we now transition from:  The DHG reviewing work before pay, to contractors reviewing peers before pay, and does not involve centralized control of work review by the proposal's author.

This proposal is for stakeholders to decide if we allow the marketing plan described here to go forward, and have each contractor listed, begin billing for the authorized work to the contractors management platform. Payments will only go out in arrears, after review and up to the amounts voted by stakeholders, with no obligation of reaching the maximum allowed budget.","328726fc2761e47538c5e8407ec1f9652fa8292db806b9c127e59a74b4b6a00ac2fa502b8651a0bc0f2b0e4d8eb344aa20c021253359341557be0620a0ad110c","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","39","5dec4416bfee322907f35f3d4aacff8487c44cd3cd13d527955cd0c57d0a5f4750899aa9cb2ac2ce97b1ec4d7c1da932d840f0b408258626e9f1bb7cd1c35e0b",1551210308,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/39","nnnko56",NA,16,15,9,NA

Your concerns about transparency are legitimate. I just want to add a little context from the perspective of Decred contractor working in another domain, with no relationship to Dustorf. 

**a)** Decred contractors don't work here for the money. I don't know how much Dustorf makes, but I know I could make much more money elsewhere (was before I started working here). I took a massive pay cut because, like most, because it's a meaningful way to make a living. Part of that is not being micromanaged and having some privacy. If the stakeholders force more transparency and a negotiation around pay, contractors pay will likely go _up_, not down. I'm open to that conversation actually, as I believe better ""price discovery"" will allow the project to pay better while delivering the same or better value. But know that privacy and autonomy are a big part of the ""compensation package"" that allows stakeholders to get stellar talent on the cheap. 

**b)** re: jy-p trying to be the ""CEO of the treasury"", I sense that's been somewhat true (though to be clear, I don't have insight into this process). As far as I've seen though, this is common in any crypto project with a real budget. Some centralization is necessary at first, then projects decentralize over time. What is important is that there's a real commitment to decentralization and a plan, not just words. I would argue the fact we're having this conversation here is evidence of that decentralization happening. Before, this budget would just have been approved by jy-p and other ""insiders"" (again, don't know the process, but I'm assuming it was fairly centralized). But now, the power to approve budgets has been moved to _you_. Stakeholders _could_ vote this down. And further decentralization is continually discussed and planned (e.g. the DCC). The long game is to have funds literally managed by a smart contract, no humans. If you want this machine to keep going though, IMO you can't move too fast, or you risk good talent leaving the project because they don't have enough financial security to stay even if they wanted to (we're not all crypto rich, able to go long a volatile, risky asset with every paycheck). 

Again though, your concerns are legitimate. And moving the conversation forward. And inspiring me to spend half an hour writing this even though I can't bill for it.","8561f92a9a5ebc7a9b7e68cc985e02b7c48396178d8e87b83e97b44aca2cda0d99e6e3328cba4670fae53de6a81a2efaa6026680869618a52bef6fff76f83c01","1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","40","87824ebe9d61a8bfe36f530179061218e77406b71925ac9b30604212b35bb902773ffe9857e00f6de24f475c9967a11bd7e82b6892444d6745dbcd953f70ba04",1551212138,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/40","s_ben",NA,16,16,8,NA

It's perfectly OK to vote no to this proposal if you believe there are issues with it; some people are doing just that. There are also people who are probably confident enough in voting yes, solely based on the track record of past expenses, as the treasury has grown to a sizeable amount during a period where the DHG really could have run with the money, but didn't, and delivered instead. If we were able to know exactly who voted yes or no and to which amount the system would be broken and a privacy risk  for all stakeholders. The idea is that instead, we know for sure that those who vote, do so proportionally to how much stake (risk) they have, regardless of who they are.

Regarding disclosure of personal information, personally I would fight any initiative stripping away privacy from anyone involved in Decred (contractors, devs, stakeholders, users, miners, etc...). Or straight up sell all my holdings if privacy was removed by design. Decred aims to be a decentralized organization not a surveillance agency.

That argument fall short also if you take a common organization like a company, the hours / salary of every identified employee isn't public information.

It doesn't prevent people from reviewing work and expenses.
It doesn't prevent someone to get fired if he's not delivering.
It doesn't prevent shareholders from approving/refusing budgets.

Sure it's a different model entirely when your goal is decentralization and there's no central planning entity,  but keep in mind that until we're replaced by robots, we're still dealing with humans, privacy and trust.

Same. I got much more on my previous job for a corporation.

In Decred it is a challenge to maximize the billable fraction of time spent here because there's just so many interesting things to do, but you only get paid for useful work.

On top of that, add that contractors who invoice the Treasury directly absorb the full volatility damage. Sometimes this is very not pleasant and I believe it can damage the retention of work force.

I have invited a number of people and what put them off was to manually wait to do the ticket split.

As an investor in many DAO projects, I have seen the charade of sham daos played over and over again. 

As soon as strong critcism of nepotism springs up, the people asking uncomfortable questions of the private club will be branded as trolls and censored in some way or another. Others will be discouraged from voicing criticism in subtler indirect ways.

Founding teams misuse their votes and position to grab all resources (or give it to chosen ones) and control the project by proxy. When they are accused of this, they will say, bring proof  that they are controlling the votes (knowing full well nothing can be proven).

Valid criticism is encouraged.

Playbook to be branded as troll: repeat the same thing over and over again, use half-baked arguments, be over the top/emotional, abuse bold font, refuse to share your useful contributions or to simply admit their absence while asking someone's tangible results, ask to reveal wages while refusing to reveal equivalent private info of yours, undermine someone who was building trust for months while you have none, etc etc.

How does this look? Pi admins publish a detailed, line-item report as a proposal, and stakeholders can comment/vote on it?

> If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention

Is there a process for dealing with this? I don’t see it in the technical implementation. While in general this makes sense, one factor to consider is potential disruption for current contractors, the majority of which will have honest invoices. Contractors are already subject to a high volatility during their billing period (averaged USD/DCR price), and are then subject to any volatility between when they send their invoice and when it is approved and paid (which can sometimes take up to a month). In recent months, this resulted in a 50% pay cut for contractors that had to sell to USD to pay bills. If stakeholders veto a draft treasury spend, which starts some kind of dispute resolution process and requires another vote, that could cause further disruption in pay that many contractors cannot absorb, and the project may talent (which is expensive to replace). If this is only a mechanism for defense against attack, and the stakeholders have already had a chance to review invoices, this seems sensible. But this review step has not been defined yet (see above). 

> Follow-up votes will determine the fate of individual costs.

Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?

> Originally, we were keen to have draft Treasury spends be assembled off-chain via Politeia, where stakeholders would approve the draw by voting on the draft transaction. 

I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?

> If the treasury transaction is approved it will be published on-chain and the contractors will be able to redeem their individual payouts.

So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?


In general, I think this is a step in the right direction. The basic infrastructure being proposed here will needed anyway for many things. My concern is that, by punting on some larger issues (such as how contentious items in the budget are resolved (either at the front end, or after a veto of the draft by stakeholders)), we miss opportunities to make this infrastructure more future-proof. My ability to judge the technical infrastructure is limited somewhat, however, by my ability to wrap my head around some of the technical details. I’ve got a decent grasp on how blockchain transactions work generally, but am having some confusion around some of the basic logic here. 
For instance, off-chain transactions are mentioned. But are not all transactions by definition on-chain? 

In summary: It seems that the proposal (in its current from) accomplishes  three major things: guardrails on spending (which seem reasonable), safeguards against attack (in the form of a stakeholder veto on spending drafts), and lays down some basic infrastructure that will be needed down the line when further decentralization comes. But I think there are a lot of big unsolved challenges here.

That's right. The Pi administrators will publish the transaction that contains the entire treasury spend. People can look at it on the Pi website and comment before it is published for an on-chain vote. The idea is to make a human readable version of this for stakeholder evaluation.

But this review step has not been defined yet (see above).

This is an accurate statement. The process has not been formalized yet. The reason is that in the many years of software development we have learned to only plan two steps ahead and evaluate where we stand after achieving set goals. Planning too far ahead pretty much always ends with reality colliding with the plan. So, yes it is hand-wavy but by design. Once the technical realities become apparent we can let them dictate the process.

> Basically have the same question as above. Is there an imagined process for this?

See prior comment.

> I think I’m confused around the distinction between on-chain and off-chain here. Aren’t stakeholders voting on politeia proposals (such as this one) on-chain? how is this different?

Politeia votes are decidedly off-chain. One of the biggest hurdles that will be overcome in this proposal is that we finally marry the two. Only consensus and protocol changes are voted on-chain. The treasury spends will be added to that list with this proposal.

> So funds are not just sent to the contractor’s wallet address (the process now)? What is the redeem process?

This is a technical reality. Blockchain can't magically send funds. The process that we will use mirrors the stake reward system. In the end, this should have minor to no impact on UX.

This is a valid concern but this is where I point out that technical people think the other way around :-)

What this proposal does is add the basic building blocks we need in order to implement your big vision concerns. Again, the reason why some of those remain undefined is to let reality guide them vs promising something and then not being able to deliver it. Getting this stuff to work is hard enough as it is and then changing a promise during development (which invariably happens) is counterproductive.

And no, transactions are not always by definition on-chain. You can construct one and share that with people before pushing it to the mempool for inclusion on the blockchain.

The precautions of Pi draft key, constraints on the new OP codes, and staged migration of funds from the old wallet/system to the new, all seem prudent to me. I also appreciate that possible misbehavior of the Pi operators has been included in the threat model (voting on-chain so that Pi admins cannot censor votes). This rationale and motivation is familiar from Politeia itself, where the transparent censorship features have been designed by the same set of people who would have otherwise had power to abuse the system. I take this as further evidence that Company 0 is committed to moving towards a decentralized system that has no special role or privilege for themselves.

Some more specific questions/comments:

1. ""If the transaction is voted down it will need to be reviewed and potentially broken up to deal with contention.

It would be good to have a more detailed walkthrough of what would happen in this scenario, with a prospective timeline. I don't think this is needed yet, it could be done at some point while this system is being engineered. Alternatively, it may be worth breaking the spending down into 2 or 3 payments/domains to start with, in which case the monthly ticket votes would provide a more nuanced signal of how stakeholders perceive the value the Treasury is getting per domain. From a contractor perspective, if the approval rating for these big transactions was trending down month by month, it would be sub-optimal to not have a sense of where the perceived problems lie (e.g. is it on the dev or marketing side?).

I'm going to have to meditate a bit on this, but for the moment  few questions regarding the technical side of things:

1. Given that the pi draft key will need to be part of consensus, what would be the point of a wallet ""distrusting"" the draft key (technical point 6)? It seems to me that once the consensus vote for introducing OP_TGEN/OP_TSPEND is approved, the only action available for a wallet is to vote yes/no/abstain on the spend transaction.

2. Clarifications for:

> Don't allow more than one approved OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks)

So this will also block having two OP_TSPENDs being voted at the same time, right? Obviously I assume the pi operators won't honestly broadcast a new OP_TSPEND before the last one is either decisively voted approved/disapproved, I'm just trying to wrap my head around the consensus semantics for this tx type.

Also, will this be considered a stake transaction or a regular transaction (and therefore subject to block approval)? I'm assuming onchain voting on approval of TSPEND tx will only start after it's sufficiently confirmed.

3. On the example for the spend transaction, shouldn't inputs be:

```
in[0] =  <Pi draft key sig> TSPEND
```

that is, the sigscript is carrying a signature made by the pi draft key vs the key itself. Also, wouldn't it be better for the pi draft key actually be a multisig script or even a schnorr multisig key (with the corresponding p2sh being the consensus-enforced receiver of TGEN txs)? I'm just considering that, in case of a compromised (single) key, all payments would necessarily stop until a consensus change vote to replace the key is carried, which is less critical if it's only a single compromised key from a multisig set.

4. It would be helpful to see an example of a coinbase tx with OP_TGEN (similar to how it was done for OP_TSPEND).

5. Random thought: how about using the extended vote bits to signal approval/disapproval of individual outputs of the TSPEND tx? It would make tallying the votes slightly trickier, but alleviate some concerns about the on-chain voting blocking payment to all contractors due to a single ""undesired"" output (from the pov of voters).","6d50ee18c4072851056a0eeed6efa70cc1c12f851925190ff6d4caeb6d78e51037b139c6250330167612ba1ae12a0b605298a5bb7de359d5445456f67151da03","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","9","b6e07ed3b7fb6f0d4f00a56be41db12cf1259773be86e3a1f37bbad252a9e8748ac11f846efbe4ddc8e188cb36bccccdb5070401c4f98e0dba57b58524c8180e",1554292915,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/9","matheusd",NA,12,12,8,NA

While I don't understand the technical details on the level of matheusd, I do think it is important to have some flexibility moving forward. Being restricted to a binary yes/no on something as complex as potentially hundreds of contractors and other expenditures, seems like a bad idea.

I have three technical concerns:

1. As others have mentioned, the fact that a vetoed treasury spend on chain delays that entire month's payouts is concerning. Contractors shouldn't be stuck waiting to get paid over contention with a single line item in the spend tx. I would much prefer an output-by-output on-chain approval.
1. What happens if there is a genuine mistake on the part of the Pi operators in creating the on-chain tx? Would this would be resolved by voting down the entire tx, and trying again next month (possibly running us up to the 150% accrued value limit for the next month)?
1. There is a limit of one OP_TSPEND per 28 days (8064 blocks). What if there's a drop in hashpower, making 8064 blocks take more than a month to produce? This could result in late payments and disgruntled contractors.","6ed275a45d7d4f4000535152d4fc1628ec599fb2d9873b244e2f1e1ea0bdcc885049abefef41538fa070fa8b3198cc5af8d4a415d8b9ed509ef7641369d22509","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","dafb49ac06c888235c4fb9833b30b51f4560d65aecfb7dcdd797b53404de3f4da3e461d22dc2c6d5ab6952223963b1a75e4a261ffa0245a7e3280d68a830b50d",1554332543,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/12","ryanzim",NA,11,11,8,NA

2. Yes, that is correct.  There would be a permanent vote bit assigned to voting on a treasury spend in the same way that there is a bit voting for the disapproval of the previous block.   There would be additional `OP_RETURN` data added that specifies the hash of the transaction that is being voted on in the same way that the block that is being voted on is included via that mechanism.  Then there would be separate consensus rules that enforce the spending limits.  That would theoretically allow the potential to spend more than once from the treasury in the future with a voted consensus change as well as allow immediately publishing an amended treasury spend since failure to get enough votes on the initial spend would effectively invalidate the old draft transaction.  These are the types of specific details that would be in the DCP.


3.  Yes, the proposal should have specified a signature there.

In regards to your questions regarding p2sh in terms of key compromise, it would just move the problem into the p2sh instead of the output of the coinbase because the script itself has to be consensus enforced, as you noted, so there would have to be a vote to change the script too.

Something I think the proposal does not do a good job of explaining is that `OP_TGEN` and `OP_TSPEND` create what is effectively an account for the treasury instead of using the standard utxo model.  The draft key signature also would not have the power to unilaterally spend as `OP_TSPEND` would require both a signature from that key as well as the tally of the yes votes from stakeholders, which acts as an efficient proxy for all of their signatures, to succeed.  That approach also cleanly solves the issue where you would have a bunch of tiny inputs (one per block) in large treasury payouts resulting in massive transactions that would violate size limits.  The outputs of the spending transaction itself can spend to an valid script as usual.


4. There isn't much to show since it would consist of exactly one opcode, named `OP_TGEN'.

A current coinbase looks like:
```
out[0] = <OP_HASH160 <current treasury script hash> OP_EQUAL>
out[1] = <OP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc>
out[2] = <OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <miner pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG>
```

A new coinbase under this proposal would look like:
```
out[0] = <OP_TGEN>
out[1] = <OP_RETURN 4e1305004fdcced262afa8dc>
out[2] = <OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <miner pubkey hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG>
```

It requires consensus enforcement of only being valid in the very specific case of the first output of a coinbase transaction and that script being required to be exactly `OP_TGEN`.

5. That wouldn't work because a transaction is either valid or it's not.  There is no notion of partially-valid transactions.  The draft transaction is called that in the proposal because that is what it really would be.  It would remain off chain, but publicly available, and would fail validation until all spending conditions were met, namely the new semantics enforced by `OP_TSPEND`.  The result is that if anyone tried to broadcast it before it's valid, it would be rejected, and once it became valid, anyone could broadcast it independently of the Pi operators.  That is also why the votes must include the hash of the spending transaction they are voting on.","32149739bb5d5014210c1a7302dbb69a3ec87d32b963abe7401737e120367af2e263ba62fa9a3b25327044bad94c8faa6565b921e6741fdecc3ace470451e00f","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","13","9577a0995795ff78296bf7c2a90aa11fe42f22a7e381747b16327712d166abdaf5f4c51f444eb72ccf8b87e5e7b2d764490b1ea8e104061901a3510bcf093901",1554361249,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/13","davecgh",NA,11,11,8,NA

It's a fair concern, but from a technical perspective, there is no notion of partially-valid transactions and attempting to allow that would open a massive can of worms for not only these transactions, but all transactions.  Thus, an output-by-output on-chain approval would effectively require stakeholders having to vote on hundreds or thousands of individual transactions every month which does not seem very reasonable burden to impose.

2. There would be no need to wait a month.  If there were a legitimate problem with the transaction, the draft would simply be scrapped and new draft created.  Quoted what I replied with in a separate comment:

3. Allowing more than one (but a small number such as perhaps 2 of 3 to prevent attempts at abuse and burdening the stakeholders) per period so long as the sum of the amounts does not exceed the imposed spending limits seems prudent.  It's worth noting though that a drop in hash power would potentially delay payouts regardless of there being a limit.  However, it is true that only allowing 1 per fixed period of blocks could potentially result in slowly pushing the payment date forward if there is loss in hash power that is not eventually offset by an equivalent gain.","b079b9bc1c8625d31653a634c8f01c89e7718e111ec990d10e49203101d5945d1ea84251b0153465e726f76684613f03f1b86bc1cdca97c3abb670aa0fff560f","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","14","7827897ae5b7ace7911f3902cf6d50955ed870a94b6379feb700cbfc0a7126f055691319ab12c56de201788f57ce9263f3c25e4683d596d5fc63a46c46423a09",1554363849,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/14","davecgh",NA,11,11,8,NA

Ah ok, that makes more sense now.

I assumed the tx would be voted on _after_ being broadcasted and mined, but if it's before (and the votes are carrying the hash of the future valid tx) then I believe corrections for contentious payments can be issued faster: within the first (say) 24h of voting, if it's clear that a particular payment is receiving too many ""no"" votes, just generate a new one and start voting on _that_. Whichever tx is approved with the highest margin within the 2016 block window is considered valid, all others are not.

On the one hand, introducing an account semantics for the treasury definitely improves scalability and usability (by reducing the utxo set, removing the need for largish payment txs as you said, easier tracking by adding the balance to a header commitment, etc) so that's a nice positive.

On the other hand, that's a pretty big departure from a utxo-set only architecture, so we'll need to see exactly how that is going to be defined in the future DCP.","5b493aa89dbdfbb7040f0219188afb96d89d832ea1160f0da30c0e5edbb4348fa26d9d5c7768b7ffd7d1872153fc4252a6eac6cea9533f21f3a8519aae5ef301","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","18","dd684cd296e19216918e24f9c956fda34338b66b71c6ecb34ed9423950cc9a4295f29fda6bde1b744e8a2b56a9963c93fdee90d85b4d2dffe8fdee334154c90c",1554480511,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/18","matheusd",NA,10,10,8,NA

Sorry I don't follow how does it work. Once the pi draft key is included in consensus as the one that can craft the draft tx, the only two options to ""distrust"" it are 1) voting No for tx singed with it, or 2) voting to change consensus again to use another key. If clients are locally configured to ""distrust"" the draft key, what does it influence?

Pay volatility is a problem for me too. Put simply, not getting the money you billed for is a problem if you can't afford the gamble.

Reducing the delay between the end of the billing period (end of month) and the payment reduces the impact of volatility. But to really solve it there must be a mechanism to offer stable pay for desired part of the wage. If that is achieved, the delay can be longer.

There is another risk - they can be coerced to reveal stakeholder information (IP addresses, email addresses, support comms, voting addresses).

Even without pressing VSPs, the fact that many voting addresses are reused helps blockchain analysis to connect the dots. It can be used to identify stakeholders, who can be coerced to vote certain way not only on treasury spend but on blocks, consensus changes and proposals. Or just give away their funds. More stakeholder and voter privacy makes higher security of the network.

With this design VSPs will play even bigger role than today and be more wanted targets. Despite being critical part of infrastructure VSP software has serious privacy flaws and doesn't even receive regular code updates (multiple open issues and pull requests are idle for months).

I think it is important to pump VSP privacy before this treasury spend system comes into effect, specifically:

1. [eliminate VSP address reuse](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/311) and associated clustering of voter funds which degrades their privacy
2. [make email address optional](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) and recommend to create new accounts
3. do best effort to [eliminate accounts](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/100) alltogether
4. if 3 turns too hard, at least make it possible to register with VSP without web browsers, directly from dcrwallet or another CLI tool (and by extension from Decrediton)","08c581296832b9323a312791f66ec342af001dacfdd3793bf35f4ca9459116dfe7fb97682ab8db87d195d4f6a4c57346019c91a5e17c47627159259e76481d02","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","23","ac47f8e7d1e511f88e7f241b67cfe448c0d46fbc12f0bb61ed7815187b351737a5c3f08808be608bbe8ceb95f346a96119727b19f2468084384a88ef04088502",1555231412,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/23","bee",NA,9,9,8,NA

Auditing treasury spends would add even more load to voters who already barely reach 20% quorum on proposals. Limited attention span and voter apathy is a challenge in all voting systems. Also, voters have vacations too.

Unlike regular proposals, if enough voters don't meet in a short time window to audit and approve the tx, missed quorum can paralyze contractor activity.

Speaking of a tradeoff between voters having enough time and contractors getting payments sooner, Is there a limit to how long can the spend be negotiated?

Current months treasury accumulation + 50%.

Hundreds.

> How will stakeholders' vote transactions look like?

This is indeed not very obvious from the text. What will happen is that we will add a permanent agenda that takes the vote identifier as the parameter and it'll then record the vote bits as any other agenda. We plan to let the user trust the Pi key and always vote per settings. This is to alleviate user interaction.

That is part of the plan. We need those anyway so this is a nice excuse to get it all in.

> Why VSPs are needed to vote for the tx? Can't stakeholders just throw their votes into mempool and have them mined?

That would be great but that is not how it works. Voting requires signatures so something needs to be online to sign hence VSPs exist.

> Do (1) and (2) refer to exactly the same thing? Does ""off-chain"" simply mean it is not immediately published on the chain?

You have asked this before and the answer is not changing. Yes, they are the same, yes the transaction is published on Pi and not on the blockchain.

Does it mean two maturation periods or one?

Just one for the treasury transaction. The redeem transaction has normal blockchain rules. Only transactions that generate new coins are subject to maturation.

> Is ""this month"" it defined as a block interval (e.g. 8064 blocks) or a calendar month?

The plan is to use 8064 blocks.

> Do OP_TSPEND transactions have min and max block height (expiry)? How long can broadcasting of this tx be delayed? Can it slip into next month?

Ideally, it should be voted on before the next month. But I don't see any issues with voting on last months transaction at this time. Reality will set me straight. We will have to add pretty extensive UT for these changes and this is one of the edge cases we are going to have to reason through.

One of the goals of the contractor management system (CMS) is to lower this time between billing and payout.","d2a056d63af0abcdd083809bddfd8af622b8dc06ce73c7d66e30544aa738fa573cb39f6cba886bf07fc06470468cc7ae1e83657a1f6dcd16e2ad5b841828c20c","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","34","88fa1259f871279a32b9fb4a4f6a5bd013aa98ae39c4e1b9132c05004c938bf5b9e479981ca8ee323539aa2f9f58354cb71eb327a7a16af705701bda63a3b804",1557161437,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f/comments/34","jy-p",NA,9,9,8,NA

""Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50%""

I think this is fine for a 60% approval threshold. However, I envision unique and one time expenses that could arise in the long term future that could find the above constraint limiting. For example, an acquisition/buy in of a side project or feature like a decentralized oracle infrastructure integrated with Decred, would be expensive. The Decred community may want to make large one time spends from the Decred Treasury in the future. My concern is that the above constraint would prevent these in the first instance, and require a change in the consensus rules first before going through with a large expense. And maybe this should be the case, since it's essentially requiring a pre-vote before the main vote of the large expense.

There's a couple other ways this could be expanded though.

For instance:

Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 50% (requires 60% approval)

Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 100% (requires 70% approval)

Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 150% (requires 80% approval)

Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 200% (requires 90% approval)
 
Prevent spending more than this months treasury accrued value + 300% (requires 99% approval)

This proposal is potentially an end around the current contractor model we already have in place (not that I think that's the intention), it could damage a lot of the progress and positive cultural value that has been derived from it, and also curtail additional value we would surely gain from protecting the integrity of the contractor model in place.

I think Decred could be exposed to adverse selection, while we may find quality people, we will still have no experiential knowledge of their long term dedication to Decred until some point into the 12 months process.

In addition we will have committed to some evangelists that we discover are not the ""right fit"".well before the 12 months is up, but we are still beholden to through the end of the 12 month term?

To a large extent I already see every contractor at Decred and many more community participants as evangelists.  I'm sure a great majority own DCR, and already have ample incentive to fulfill a majority of the functions you outline above. 

Decred may be better off just stoking our community members that have already shown alignment and skin in the game to enhance this evangelist mandate that many already hold.

Lastly, the proposed path could undercut and disincentivize our aforementioned contractors that are already compensated and reflexively fulfilling the role of evangelists.

I understand the critiques. Definitely, I felt some of the same tensions when I put on my community member hat to review my own proposal.  

Thanks for giving me a chance to explain my thought processes in arriving at this particular framing, and I look forward to the dialogue that unfolds. 

I am a big believer that through dialogue we can sharpen our ideas, planning, and execution.

Let me start by saying, I have zero pride in the ideas put forward, and my singular goal is in driving towards the success of the Decred 'digital sovereign' economy.

In an earlier draft of the proposal, I had tried to make the selection of the BD evangelists something that would happen based on a rolling 3-month community vote based process, but then, just before agreeing to let the proposal go live, I changed the mechanism to a more traditional method of hiring and firing, for fear that the rolling-vote just wouldn’t be pragmatic, for three reasons, (1) I wouldn’t be able to design a mechanism to administer the rolling vote, (2) if I tried to it would be a distraction to the real goal of getting deals done for Decred with a sense of urgency as this entire space is heating up and Decred community members want to put points on the board, and (3) I wanted to ensure adherence to some deep beliefs that I’ve learned thru practical experience building BD teams.   

As context, in the organizations I've built to date in my career I've hired ~ 400 people, and let-go ~ 100 of them, and about 40 of these people have been BD focused, so I have some experience with how difficult it is to build and manage high-performance teams, including BD teams, and have a lot of scars, successes, and some deep beliefs anchored in these years of learnings. 

Since I am personally aligned with Decred's future with my time and resources at a significant and meaningful level of commitment, I got started with the proposal process with an ‘owner’s mentality’ wanting to make Decred successful to maximum possible extent in short-, medium-, and long-term.  

Thus, I wanted to put forward a model where I can bring to the table the best of what I've learned thru my personal experiences building high-performance BD teams to commercialize new technology, which includes three key lessons after many years of trial-and-error learning: 

(a) BD specialists compensation should be primarily performance-based since most of the time they fail to deliver anything of any use (i.e. they should 'eat what they kill'), 

(b) by aligning interests of a dozen BD specialists with relationship access to different organizations and industries we can run lots of BD pitches and experiments in parallel to learn by trial-and-error where the ""spaghetti sticks to the wall"", i.e. where we have ""product market fit"", and 

(c) we want to establish a culture whereby BD specialists who are not putting their heart and soul into winning results are quickly released to pursue other passions w/ an open, direct, positive, and encouraging exit-interview.

Re this last point, we call this 'hatch and release' in the tech company I lead today, which I believe is a term coined at Genentech where ruthlessness in 'hatch and release' has been attributed to the strength and success of the Genentech's current team and culture by some of the long-time veterans there.  (Generally, 'hatch and release' within 30 days would be a great model to follow for the entire Decred contractor community, imho, whether we are talking about BD contractors or otherwise.)

Definitely, aspirationally, as I said above, I had initially and instinctively wanted to try and make the selection and release of the contractors community-based, to be more consistent with Decred community values, with some kind of rolling vote process.  However, from an implementation standpoint, I didn't know how to quickly or effectively implement the ""hatch and release"" idea, which really is done through personal relationships, and requires the assessment of many human factors, i.e. effort, punctuality, body language, communication, etc., and also requires seeing whites-of-eyeballs and hearing tone of voice when discussing client relationships, closing likelihoods, ‘knock backs’, lessons learned, etc.  I really, genuinely honestly don’t know how the entire Decred community can be involved in such a process of managing if/when ‘hatch & release’ needs to happen, at least not in a way that is efficient.

As a separate item, I don't understand enough about how the current contractor platform works to know if I could build on the infra in some way to accomplish some or all of my intended result.  If someone has suggestions for how to accomplish the three intended principles (including, especially, 'hatch and release') in a way that is more consistent with the Decred contractor management system and norms that we have today, I am super open-minded about re-working the entire proposal.  Again, I have zero pride, and I'm only trying to help Decred succeed.  

That being said, I would prefer not to relax on adhering to any of these three principles stated above, as, for me, keeping to these three key principles are what I know from my empirical experience can bring about success in commercializing new technology and exploring many major industries and prospective partnerships to find product market fit quickly & at lowest cost.

So, to my thought process, since I didn't know how to accomplish these three principles using the current contractor model, basically, in a spirit of pragmatism, I defaulted to asking the Decred community to ""trust me"" in administering a BD program through personal relationships, with my reputation as a contractor on the line in delivering it, and with the 'centralized trust' that the Decred community would bestow upon me to run a small team limited to a 1-year experimental program.  

Basically, this procurement model that I'm suggesting Decred follow to retain my services is similar to how a government grants a concession to a contractor to operate a metro or airport for a fixed period of time, or to protect the green zone in a war torn country, etc. etc.

Re my thinking about a 1-year term, that was based on the insight that the enterprise sales cycle is typically 6-months to 18-months, and recruiting BD specialists (many of whom are busy, successful people w/ day jobs), educating them on Decred, getting pitch materials prepared, making pitches, gathering feedback, tweaking pitches, discussing pricing, going to exec level, drafting proposals to the Treasury, etc. is going to require a year or so to programmatically bear fruit.  Probably 18-months would be safer, but, I proposed 1-year as I thought it would be the minimum responsible time to seeing indications of progress.

In the spirit of pragmatism, since the BD evangelists would not actually be paid by Decred directly, but instead are earning a % of ‘match funds’ that they bring to the Treasury from external customer organizations, the cash outlay from the Decred Treasury to the BD specialists would be zero, and the risk-return proposition to the community of the proposal would be very good.

I should note, the process I would follow in recruiting BD contractors would emphasize aligning experienced BD specialists (some of whom will be employed at major top 20 tech companies) who have existing relationships where they have sold technology before and have helped their customers be successful.  If we can make pitches thru their existing relationships, without wasting a lot of time needing to develop and nurture new sales leads, we can short-circuit the regular sales cycle and process of forming personal trust with sales leads to a certain extent.","d5cbfa5116cde888e6d2ad820897bc1cb15b50fdd1f2ae7dc2874c0cdb98826199be83f84413da87f8b7b9078112f2920411de9d2f9af6799332770442949507","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","3","a7a8902bada194d2b259ebee4c1ee034be43a8eb133c59875111ec2de4a5f13e3bc6cee50d6fe8091cf4901a0cc0efe97b6debe7d73bb850021284314a38550e",1559114190,0,0,FALSE,NA,"cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627/comments/3","betterfuture",0,0,0,0,0

Hypothetically, Decred can procure work at level of individual human beings for specific tasks (like the Epstein proposal in voting now); teams of many people for projects that might contain hundreds of tasks (such as this proposal, here), or entire organizations with hundreds of people for major programs that might contain many sub-projects  and thousands of tasks.    (probably the latter option to procure entire programs would be impossible at current price of DCR , but, if together we can grow this economy to $10B market cap... and the Treasury has a billion to allocate, could we get there?). From what I’ve read online, I believe that the Decred founders wanted to have an ability to procure ""entire teams"", with experienced managers coordinating these teams towards the accomplishment of larger goals that the community might prioritize accomplishing.  If this is truly the intention, then perhaps community members can view the present proposal not as circumventing the ""single human-being contractor hiring system"", but instead as a complementary mechanism to procuring performance-oriented teams.

+++

In summary, as a new prospective contractor, it would be helpful for me to understand answers to the following questions so that I can think about re-working the proposal once all of the feedback has been collected:

(1) Scope of Contracts Awarded.  Does the Decred community have a view on what is the ""most efficient unit of procurement""?  Is hiring high-performance “teams” a priority?

(2) Decred Contractor Management System.  Are there any ways that we might utilize the contractor management system in the proposal that I've put forward here, and also adhere to the three principles of running a successful BD organization that I've also outlined, above?

(3) Community Norms and Processes. Are there any suggestions on how I might re-work the proposal in a way that would be more consistent with community norms and processes established to date?","267cc61773d902831d25ae308e80f639130f0d4ae8763cea742d027cb6909b12563fb5b187f797ee507731d30ede9814c2fb5b0480f881bd394695ac2d590503","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","4","0aad7edf0c5aa1ed72bfe3c96daf465cd18eaecf1ef213c4d1dbd60920b678b0f03cec28424a288da88540ea976666dd3d733e9be814718b31dba4a8473ace0e",1559114531,0,0,FALSE,NA,"cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627/comments/4","betterfuture",0,0,0,0,0

 -- I think part of the reason the optics of the proposal elicited a feeling that it is ""potentially an end around the current contractor model"" is that I tried to frame it as an open Decred BD program, whereas, instead, I should have proposed it as offering a high-performance team that would operate and function similar to Company 0 or Ditto.

 -- Where the framing got confused, is that I tried to propose a hybrid model that would strike a balance _between_ bringing to the table a high-performance team (with a goal of putting points on the board for Decred as fast as possible) _with also _opening-up access to apply to join this team thru_an 'open access system' (with a goal of making the program more inclusive in line with Decred's _open community values_).  My thinking was that this hybrid model could empower anyone within the community to apply to become a BD Evangelist on the team, including especially existing contractors who have shown loyalty, commitment, etc.   Probably my intuition to balance these two goals of _high-performance team_ with _open-access to apply to join _wasn't immediately obvious. 

 -- As a thought experiment, how do you think you would react if I re-wrote the proposal to offer an experienced Silicon Valley BD team, i.e., 5 to 7 individuals with current or recent day jobs at Apple, Bosch, Cisco, Google, Oracle, Symantec, VMWare, etc. The goal of this fit-for-purpose BD team would be to explore if there is a market opportunity to sell Decred infrastructure to large tech companies and enterprises who might be compelled to build on top of this infrastructure, but might need to pay a contractor within the ecosystem to build an adapter, App, extension.  In addition to coordinating such a team, and getting the team up the learning curve and pitching to targets, and quickly doing ""hatch and release"" with team non-performing team members, we would also seek to involve the subset of community members who applied to join the team in an inclusive way.

 -- Re the philosophical question of ""optimal unit of procurement for Decred"", I believe that for the next 18 months or so while Decred sits in the $250m to $2.5b scale the optimal procurement model is to hire single ""high-performance teams"" with very specific goals and objectives set forth in each proposal contract, and then cutting the team off from future contracts if they don't meet or beat expectations.  Such a team would typically comprise 1 team lead,  3-15 team members, and a 3-12 month scope of work.  I could explain my rationale if anyone was interested, but, I'm going to try and keep this post a bit shorter, so will end here for tonight. :-)","9bbd33eaf918fbdbe85da3c63e87f4af662479bb0adb905b30927731a4e35538b668960a216dd3944bcc3fda4277e9d1b8d418b4581ddafd9b94d3ace990460b","dd92f95dd474977f48f25dbc0f7a61f0733d9911703711187676ce8d8aad0079","6","c01c55061ce30b516149c6b80e5db1401b00584584f116955e1829be1cd9a5d73de071dfd198e0967c39c5ac7cc70d6d8d9bcba8b43b557816f818ae16ba2b0e",1559187689,0,0,FALSE,NA,"cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627/comments/6","betterfuture",NA,9,9,8,NA

Thank you for this proposals, it definitely is something new that we have yet to discuss as a community. At first glance, I must say that I see a few major technical issues that could make difficult to get any benefit from the efforts of eventual BD evangelists.

But before that, I have to assume that this proposal would genuinely bring valuable contributions to Decred and that associations or agreements would be productive partnerships. I'm sad to say that I know very few of these partnerships in the CC space that consist of more than : ""We use your big corp name for marketing and hype, and in exchange you use ""blockchain"" and other nice keywords so you appear to be up to date with what's popular in the media"".

So let's say we do have valuable partnership opportunities, the first problem I see is which legal entity from Decred can sign such partnership or agreement? In the decentralized world we are building, there is no central or legal entity that can take that role. Giving that role to an ""elected"" representative would be voting for centralization, and having contractors take that role, could expose them to legal obligations they have no way of enforcing because they do not control Decred and What stakeholders decide.

Then, there is the problem of who can provide the work (dev, support, etc) from the Decred side, to meet the requirements of such partnership? Our current model doesn't allow stakeholders to dictate what contractors do, or if they want to work on X or Y. The model has been described for a while as ""bring your own devs"",  so that proposals must include all steps and provide the actual means for its completion.  In the case that an evangelist were to strike a big deal, it would be impossible to assign any new task to the current dev workforce, and probably dangerous to burden individuals who may or may not be interested in that work. Otherwise, if the tasks rely only on the partnered business, there's no need for a partnership in the first place.


I do however agree that there's a place for BD around Decred. In some way, anyone already has the legitimacy to act as an ""evangelist"" or to approach potential businesses. I see partnerships and agreements more as complete proposals that stakeholders could vote on. For example, someone could envision time-stamping youtube videos, gather a small team of devs, and leverage contacts at Google, to write up a joint proposal for it.

If you're familiar with the ""Building on Bitcoin"" initiative and events,  I believe this ""model"" makes a lot more sense to bring businesses around a cryptocurrency like Decred.  And we do have many unique traits that makes ""Building on Decred"" really attractive,  from getting paid for contributions, to leveraging the whole open-source ecosystem like politeia, dcrtime, CMS, lightning network, etc... and our vibrant community of devs, stakeholders and enthusiasts.","6ce15c876f6d8311d85b2a67b7e50279f58050a2e0053fe496cc1f7344026fb49d10227fbe0c8cd9cb3043d599fba0108f1acfbe062e1d27cb326d076029930a","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","7","ede1e85c5c32cdbac0d93b945e38f5cb4ce3f5cf005bb4384492108fedc7dbfdb934436c2743517ed65ee4fec1c57792d84cd21e01b049db1016b515cb5cff02",1559264970,0,0,FALSE,NA,"cb446a469987d6603d93f442ef0d4e45bacbea47a72b5ce89f9c3cac3868d627/comments/7","nnnko56",NA,14,14,8,NA

Yes, for this proposal to advance, we'll need to take a bit of a leap of faith and assume that if we deploy a skilled BD team we can find a few legitimate use cases for this decentralized infrastructure, where ""big tech"" and ""big government"" would start to, nibble, bite, and buy.  That needs to be explored, but, lets assume for a moment it is a viable idea.

Now, to the question of ""who at Decred signs the agreement?""  Here is the proposed solution that I have in mind:  An enterprise co-development partner can announce its pledge to a decentralized project like Decred by having one of its officers prepare a public letter explaining the purpose of their ""earmarked contribution to the Treasury"" and then posting this letter to a public forum such as Reddit.  This is similar to how donors pledge funds to Universities, who, for reasons of not wanting to lose their ""not for profit status"" cannot enter into normal bilateral contractual agreements promising deliverables.  This happens all the time at Stanford and MIT, with major corporate donors making pledges to University industry affiliate programs vis-a-vis making monetary pledges via hand-signed, PDF'd, and emailed letters and following through on a voluntary basis with a wire transfer.  Since it is a public-spirited commitment, social enforcement mechanisms seem to be sufficient, and a donor who welches will be looked down upon within the social circles of the University, and will in effect become ostracized, excluded, and cut-off from the community.  Decred is creating the same ""social community"" within which social enforcement, as opposed to strict legal enforcement, can work well.

I really like the YouTube time-stamping example.  I have a friend who works in that part of Google, and I can chat with him about it.

Re the question of who does the development work?  Maybe an answer is that any proposal that would create developer load must also come with a staffing plan for who would perform the work, or else the community won't take the proposal seriously, and won't approve it?  As the community grows, hopefully we can see more contractor teams getting up to speed and bringing capacity to the ecosystem.  Is that satisfactory?

The governance call to speak to representatives of each proposal would add significant overhead to the proposal submission process. I generally prefer to avoid conference calls, and would not be keen to see one like this become an important part of Decred's proposal governance. 

If these calls were happening and paid for by the Treasury they would influence observers' perception of Politeia, so the stakes would be fairly high. Proposal owners may feel compelled to participate as part of the submission process if the call is treasury funded.

Only major issue I have is the limiting the scope of projects to accept bug reports.

chappjc:
Oh, and I want to warn early on that dcrstakepool may need to be treated differently, at least to start.  It was supposed to have gotten love from the operators, but alas, the open source mentality is not too strong when there's competition it seems.
I know for a fact that when critical bugs have been identified in the past, certain pools had mysteriously already patched themselves for a supposedly newly discovered bug.
Expect people to pop up and demand money to port their fixes.
That's the idea I guess, but we should be aware there might be a flood of this kind of thing for dcrstakepool
I'm referring to bugs in the past that can do things like crash the process, or eat CPU.  AFAIK, there aren't any severe hacks

chappjc:
TBH, it needs a version 2, nearly fresh.

degeri:
Thanks for the heads up. We can edit the the minimum criticality to high and above if we face such issues.

* What is the reasoning of not bundling this together with Marketing 2019, and why some meetups and quarterly events are part of Marketing 2019 and not this proposal?
* How do you feel about the ~$400K spent on events in 2018? Was it worth it and why?
* Is there (or will there be) a breakdown of 2018 events expenses?
* Based on indirect observations I always perceived Consensus as a money making machine for the organizers. Note that events are completely not my domain, I'm just curious as a stakeholder. iirc Decred was on one Consensus before, was it worth the ~$50K and why?
* I would love to see Decred in front of [CCC and FOSDEM](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/83) attendees, they might have a ton of engineers for whom 'sovereignty' means something. Is facilitating those in the power of this proposal?
* Reporting was a common omission for events. There was very few reports, a lot of talks were not recorded, the information was not nicely organized. Now that event expenses are brought to stakeholder ratification, it is reasonable to agree on reporting schedule. Ideally, for every event there is someone responsible for producing and sharing a report that would include (or link to) a text writeup, total expense and any recorded photos/video/audio. Ideally, all reports are organized in something like decred-events repo, while large media materials are self-hosted on some file server.

* I broke apart the Events from the Marketing Proposal because I didn’t want to present too much in a single proposal. Events were a primary tactic of Decred last year, so it seemed like a natural split. I’ve broken out the local meetups from these events because the meetups are done more autonomously by community members across the world. These events are slightly more centralized, as they’re planned by the Decred team in Matrix, not simply any individual who wants to coordinate something for Decred. Based on the input I’ve received on each proposal, I might propose more than two to break out separate, chunky ideas as their own proposals.

* As a disclaimer, I was not involved in the event decision making process last year, and I was only involved in the planning for WebSummit. I understand what was done and why, and I believe there are certainly areas where we can optimize our presence. I’ll speak to those later, as you ask explicitly in your last question.

Last year, the project had stronger purchasing power and event attendance was strong. It’s easy to see why the decision was made to attend the events we did. Whether it was worth it is an interesting question, in part because there’s no counterfactual we can point to. I’ve seen many of the benefits myself when I talk about events and marketing plans for 2019 in that these events have brought our community members together, expanded our community, and enabled cooperation. Examples:

At NABTC in January, 2018, the Decred team met Sid Maresh, who is now, more than a year later, helping to organize the San Francisco community with regular Decred meetups. The first one is March 6, 2019 featuring Luke Powell and the Placeholder VC team. This is a strategic area rich with devs fluent in Golang. There’s massive potential to add devs, expand the community in a strategic location, and bring more contributors to the project.

In 2018, Decred attended events across Europe, enabling communities to form that have become autonomous. The UK team and the Polish teams have formed bonds and are working on behalf of Decred without the need for centralized coordination. I propose one large event per continent, in large part, to enable teams to form that can operate more autonomously in their region.

* Expenses for the 2018 events were given to me as a single, lump sum approximation by jy-p. I would bet that he prefers to spend his time on new features rather than old accounting, but that’s up to him.

* Consensus is likely the most important annual event because it attracts the right people. Relationships with individual contributors, developers, media, other contributors and potential partners in the ecosystem, media, and strategic partners matter. It’s the single place everyone congregates, and the face time we get is where we can help solve challenges such as a lack of liquidity, lack of awareness, and so on. Trading volume was extremely high around that time, and the value of Decred was extremely high, particularly in relation to BTC. It’s not the place you’ll find bee, but it has value to the project.

* CCC and Fosdem are definitely in play. In the past, I’ve attempted to get traction for Fosdem and GopherCon, but the point of failure has been the unwillingness of Decred team members with strong technical skills to attend the events. It’s only developers who can vet other developers, so they’re a necessary component. If you can help facilitate their attendance, I’m in full support.

* Events happen, but it’s critical to maximize the value and the legs of the events. We can do this through reporting, which can help us improve and optimize our presence and spending. Heyvj has established a method for documenting events [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Event-Report-Template), which I’ve contributed to for NABTC, and which will be a standard practice for all events covered in this proposal. These should be completed within one week of the event.

As you mention, events generate content of two types where Decred can more strongly convert upon going forward. The first part, you mention is video content. When Decred representatives speak at events, they demonstrate authority on a topic, and we would like to propagate that as much as we can. I believe we can leverage that content both on YouTube, as well as our updated website. The second type of content we can leverage is simply imagery related to the events. JZ has brought up the idea of always having a designated photographer at an event to document things. This helps yield social media content in real time, and also contributes to a digital asset repository that has multiple benefits, including for media coverage.","58e93b0fbb0e02698addaa604f9f11edae1d0ee79787d8c90c6a8799549649d5eecacdf6840a862600644e5fe473b63b9f862f30df348d2fb60c3be32c850608","2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","14","231c9370ece084e52ceb22722f390e70e5dd61657945f7e8bdc07d8f22c89d3d349d6d1d70ecb85a8affcfe312affaa172c419ecdeeeb2927ac572b288021502",1551286212,0,0,FALSE,NA,"d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509/comments/14",NA,NA,9,9,8,NA

While Dennis has indeed generated the videos, as agreed upon, he is asking for 10 times the original amount quoted for the videos  USD 7,500 instead of USD 750.  This was such a massive departure from what I have seen in the past, with respect to contractor billing, that I felt it needed to go up as its own proposal, which was communicated to Dennis.

First, let’s have a quick look at [Dennis’ previous cryptocurrency videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dennislovejoy).  From what I see here, I would expect a video tutorial to be 5-10 minutes in length.  These videos have runtimes of roughly 30, 19, 28, 17, 17 and 14 minutes, for a total of 125 minutes of video.  The runtime is much longer than I or any stakeholder would have expected from looking at Dennis’ existing videos.

Speaking generally, I would only consider it acceptable for a proposal to go a few 10s of percent over budget, but to go 900% over budget is just absurd.  If the quality of the videos was truly exceptional, it might be a justifiable cost, however, it is not reasonable for a contractor to go ahead and complete all this work without prior stakeholder approval and expect for it to be paid for after-the-fact.  Dennis did in fact attempt to invoice for the entire USD 7,500 after completing the work, and, after consulting with some of the other contractors, I came to the conclusion that Dennis, and any other contractor who invoices beyond their budgets outlined in their proposal, should submit an additional proposal for the billing beyond the original proposal.

After having watched several of the videos, here is a summary of my feedback:

* The videos are easily twice as long as they should be.
* Based on how long the videos are, I expect they will receive very few views.
* The level of detail in the content of the videos is pretty good.
* Lots of runtime is devoted to things that occur to me as out-of-scope, e.g. finding websites, checking websites are ‘secure’, creating logins, using email, using password managers, using exchanges, etc.
* The editing of the video in the PIP video is very choppy.  There is an edit every several seconds.
* The PIP provides limited utility in the video - I am left looking at video of Dennis looking at a screen.
* There are effectively advertisements embedded in the videos for various service/software providers, e.g. keepass.info, DashLane, Tutanota.
* A lot of focus is put on relatively intuitive processes, e.g. filling out forms, clicking on buttons, etc.
* There is no use of testnet to demonstrate ticket purchases or similar, despite it being the best way to demonstrate various processes since it does not bleed information about mainnet coins.
* There are factual errors in some important statements, e.g. that voting on proposals generates a reward.

Based on my perception of the videos as low quality (for the reasons listed above), I think that it is totally unreasonable to pay the requested amount for the videos.  Even if Dennis accepts the originally proposed amount for the videos, USD 750, I expect they will not garner many views.  More importantly than Dennis’ requested payment of USD 7,500 for this work, we must consider the precedent set by paying for work that is performed in this fashion.  While I consider it likely that Dennis’ behavior here was not malicious, this cuts incredibly close to a standard bait-and-switch setup: someone gets a proposal approved for amount X, then intentionally expands the scope and bills for 10X.

It may still be palatable if it's only a 20-30% increase (but even that is a bad idea). To put things in perspective, let's say if the original approved budget was $10,000, the overrun will be now be a whopping $100k instead!  How about that?

While i empathized your situation, i think that agreeing to this proposal will set a very bad precedent for future proposals (which has been highlighted numerous times by others).  You should have kept to your original deliverable (3 videos) before making another proposal with a completely new budget if you feel the need to extend further. By doing that, you will limit your overrun and also the the damage caused to yourself in case thing doesn't go your way. ""Going the extra miles"" is definitely not the way to go here, unless the deliverable are of exceptional qualities and way above expectations, but let's not go into that now. 

At the moment, you are only risking yourself of not being compensated fairly which i think is a real possibility here.  I'm sorry for being blunt, but i think you may have to learn this the hard way and to absorb the losses this time round and come out smarter next time. 

Either way, i truly appreciate your deliverable so far, and while i don't have any real complaint regarding the videos, i also think that there are still room for improvement in term of video length and making the deliveries more concise.

No matter what the outcome is, i certainly hope that you will not harbor any grudge or ill intention towards this project should this proposal fails. In a way, the proposal system is working exactly as it's designed for, and it is our responsibility to learn and completely understand it before submitting any proposal.

Firstly the practice of changing funding this significantly, while there is a clear cut scope, should not take root as a common and accepted approach. ""Re: Why?"" A more common sense question for the stakeholders to ask self in any similar case, is whether this approach would pass in the real life example – ie. when you're in a role of a client or let's say this request being made against an average company. The proposed work costs 750$, but then a bill is sent for 7500$. Does not compute.

If the estimated hours don't hold, then address it right away. Whether the action is eating up some hours on your end to ensure delivery, terminating the project or some compromise via updated proposal as this one. Using additional out-of-scope work as an inducement to push through this proposal is a somewhat unethical business practice.

Secondly the hours breakdown contains over 12+ full days (77h+14h) listed purely as ""Editing"" and ""Uploading & Publishing"". This averages 2 full days per clip and is absolutely over the top. Very basic editing req. of cutting together screen + cam recordings with some fine tuning on top simply does not take longer than 2-4 hours per video (of this length). 

A main reason why I've voted yes for the initial proposal was cost efficiency + speed, that being someone quickly cranking out simple and useful content. This is no longer valid as the given pricing is well into a professional motion designer/studio ballpark.","09e614b269ff226bd223eecf2200f67cab85e256767f8a98851237691d2e50a447ee4c0e411c95b8d61ff4d8e848dbf8e701e33d3a56062747e1cbe3f83e0602","1602347ec404e3209b65b29240e9146eba135a99ce3d5f73f8ee5a9115bc534a","5","fd9de946be2bbb1ba86a1bc1cc1a08e083e8e63a491f0ae2979ebebc8732be900d5aa6f4487c78a66539af20ada3a02a3ff5a45a88d3cb7620872da7c1297903",1561584437,0,0,FALSE,NA,"d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd/comments/5",NA,NA,12,12,8,NA

While Denni seemed to be generally aware of the risk he was taking here putting in all the extra hours, it does appear, from the public chats anyway, that there may have been some mixed signals from the project. And whichever way this goes, I think we can learn from this. Below is a rough summary of the conversation as I saw it unfolding in public chats (all I've seen). 

* Denni’s proposal is approved
* He iterates with community members in #writers. He’s generally enthusiastic and responsive (he made a small change I suggested). He goes way over hours by incorporating every suggested change, even though the scope is increasing beyond the original proposal. 
* He does not (publicly) report that he’s gone over hours until April 25th ([Matrix link](https://matrix.to/#/!RkRLpGpvNverwzVyVV:decred.org/$155623865827953mTuEs:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org)). He reports that he’s at 92 hours, which “well exceeds the time scheduled in my proposal (25 hours)”, and proposes the possibility of becoming a contractor and billing for the overages that way. 
* Some responses to this suggestion were supportive, but a number of comments were against this, arguing it would set bad precedent. 
* On May 14th, Denni announces in recruiting ([Matrix link](https://matrix.to/#/!RkRLpGpvNverwzVyVV:decred.org/$155786985713501sdhoK:decred.org?via=decred.org&via=matrix.org)) that after the proposal, he’ll continue forward as a contractor and send the invoice for the extra hours. He is told by a community member that, “I’m sure it will be approved”. Nobody else replies.
* On 6/3, a community member asks why Denni (presumably even further over budget at this point, but not (publicly) reporting out hours), has not submitted an invoice for May. 
* Denni reports that he’s not yet in the contractor management system, and that technically the proposal is done (initial 3 videos), but that he’s waiting on review from other community members, and should only need a week or so to finish the “post-proposal updates (6 total videos)”. He plans to submit an invoice at the end of June. A community member expresses opposition to this plan, saying that moving forward work needs to be tied to a proposal. Denni says that’s fine, thanks the comments for the clarification. There appears to be some confusion here, and presumably Denni assumes this is going to be billed under the approved Marketing budget?
* An invoice for 10x the original amount is submitted. There is community pushback, and Denni is asked to submit a proposal for the overage. 
* Denni agrees, and here we are.

While I agree this price is still too high, based on imagined ROI, and paying this could set a bad precedent, I do have some sympathy for Denni. If I imagine myself in his situation (and I was a new contractor not that long ago), it’s easy to see how he might be confused. Especially if he’s new to freelancing and open source development. At the same time, it’s clear he was also taking on a lot of risk, with comments from the community that indicate opposition to paying over budget. I assume good intentions on Denni’s part (presumably he’s just an enthusiastic freelancer that hasn’t learned the hard lesson of how to estimate work and set boundaries; every freelancer learns this one the hard way). The question is, how much of this lesson should the project pay for, if any. Would be curious to hear Denni's side of this, and what his perception of the situation was as he was going over budget.","b5df6b96b9df45b87723a79eed50e0a1f612db887f9c8530c2ad68d7543ec95dbd2d895401360acbd1196a9ac9d5f818b3697a63b667f8997981d2eefd373f0b","1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","7","07ed7f116d08b0c056f244b67f9704622351333e3267434e889445b8c1eb77a00c9a10d940b35bc4dd4410c247437bbffa60a9c118fe37debdaf862b1c3e2203",1561608388,0,0,FALSE,NA,"d8d7ff7ad138ed322422aaa4d2a3e1c61f296ae56a2c2316cc5ecd10cf8dd8bd/comments/7","s_ben",NA,11,11,8,NA

> We did a market research which shows that almost 70% of merchants would be willing to accept crypto (deCRED) only if they have enough information about how to use it and the legal aspect. Also, about 70% and 99% of the Ghanaian population has still not heard of Bitcoin and deCRED respectively.  

Can we have some more details on how these numbers were calculated ? 

>  This project will be undertaken by the deCRED Ghana team. A team of four core members with George pro as their leader.

Can we have details on the other three core members ? 


I personally do not believe in any sort of ""marketing lead"" merchant adoption.

I do like the idea of outreach to universities but id rather have it run though the existing ""Marketing"" or ""Events"" funding and approval process.","0296e22938a09bcd8e372006c711ee99d1fa7167a2062441fc99405ac7ce8ef64f1a128fff05bbbfcf26763bcdfdf2ba2c4858bed6d7755a3f3ab8b488683b0d","d18e6dc2871b96d4e0966f3a5d95acc3c1024b7557b15d24597080e4daa68a66","1","22470dbc3f0b2dc191e007a4c4e106bfbfe0ac21a206f72ee275c1d6eb977ab8e7b203fffb3fbd7da15cf05cf4f72398c13fae15a50239d0777c337b201f5303",1553098729,0,0,FALSE,NA,"dac06f18bfeb5f7667e56554774de3bb99151018ce16a64f5353bab45819763b/comments/1","degeri",NA,16,16,8,NA

Hi George,

First of all, thanks for finally putting up the proposal. At a quick glance, these are my observation, starting from the good point:

1. Motivation and its potential to decred ecosystem is sound.
2. Some of the plans stated (especially those regarding the improvement of usability of decred as a currency) is good.

Unfortunately however, the good stuff ends here, and the rest are my concern regarding this proposal, mostly regarding the execution part of the said plans. (also forgive me for being blunt)

1. The pre-amble looks lazily copy and pasted and to me, it looks like very little effort(if any) is put into researching those numbers. Merely quoting a single source no matter how reputable the source is, is just not convincing enough. The blurry image attached also seems to be hastily downloaded from somewhere.(with no credit given to its source)
2. The job scope seems a little overly ambitious for the time frame given. Given your past contributions which i've seen in slack (and I thank you for that), i also think that the budget asked is a little bit on the high side especially for a developing country which still has a relatively low cost of living. 16k for each region for each month will work out to 160k for 10 regions (if the final target is as you described) is a lot to ask for. The only concrete evidence that I observed so far were some very amateurishly put together casual meeting photos WITHOUT any video content at all. This has been asked many times because the most important is the actual content of delivery, but it seems like everytime this was brought up by the community members, you avoided the subject.
3. The plans are not detailed enough, with some random target numbers being seemingly thrown around. (i.e: 10 universities, 10 regions, 10000 target audiences??). Mind to elaborate each of this region along with its universities in question? Otherwise, this only greatly reduces the credibility of your proposal.
4. ""Constant social media marketing"": Do you have any existing proof of work being uploaded to any of the said social media? Any youtube videos? Given the extensive coverage already done by existing contributors (Ditto, Denni's tutorial video, decred digest, decred community website, official twitter/facebook, etc), how do you plan on further expanding this by creating an African specific channel? If am not wrong, English is still one of the main language being used in  Africa so the audience will have no problem looking for information in the already established sources. Creating your own social media channels seems redundant in this case.
5. Above all, have you researched the hurdle that you have to go through by asking merchants to adopt decred as a cryptocurrency payment method? Is there any known (or potential future) cryptocurrency laws in Africa that might prevent this from being implemented smoothly? How confident are you in convincing them to 'embrace' decred?
6. Referral system: You did not mention where do these referral rewards and 'winning prizes' comes from. Are they part of the budget?

These are my immediate concerns so far, i will add-on as and when i can think of a new ones. Thank you for your time to read and i hope that you will not take this the wrong way.","95b08b9ad1697c4b9bcd70c8323b952e93c61778d414af83cfbe949b60654c04e13acb9aafc68592bcd3646fba154286341a000b3ab9466b36f336bbe6d43f07","88274f3fb81b459ac4db997ce32c1ee79ed77c62ed29b5dbd4b7ef4cfad6eaf1","2","2fd827c4159bc9be40c45414ffe74c7997522d829041665618fbc1599499eeaa1f1e58e33601f48cb0379fc5cafcfb830a5845d2f48a0cea0dde480e6bcb0809",1553100348,0,0,FALSE,NA,"dac06f18bfeb5f7667e56554774de3bb99151018ce16a64f5353bab45819763b/comments/2",NA,NA,14,14,8,NA

 1. concerning preamble, it is not something we were hiding we even mentioned paxful CEO and also the website to clearly show that we copied but to say it was lazily copied is something that baffled me. we did a lot of research moving from website to website then we came about that information on Africa. We wanted the community to have an overview on how Africa is and the current state  of the continent. We copied but to say we lazily copied is somehow too strong to me. the image is quite clear over here it shocks us that  its a bit blurry after uploading. may be the quality was reduced after uploading it. All links concerning wherever we took some vital information from will be added to the proposal soon. we thought the community don't need them so we excluded most of them.
2. concerning time frame its properly proportional to the work and the ambitions we want to achieved we shall add time-line and milestone to the proposal and all that ambiguity will be solved. Thanks for recognizing our work but if you say amateurish work i agree with you some of the events we organized pictures was taken by our phone which make the work somehow look amateur but a lot went into it during and after the organization. 1. getting proper venue 2. collaboration with other events organizers in some situation we paid money before we are allow to speak 3. there are some situations that we spoke under certain events that we did not post on any community platform at all because we realized the community will say we are doing amateur work, there are situations enquiry desk was set at events for participant to ask question concerning deCRED but we never share on slack the pictures look amateur after the events. Pictures of such events will be post soon. concerning budget sorry for the privacy of the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8 check it here it will convinced you that the budget is not high and that it follows the plans and the things we budgeted for. 
4. In case of social media we are still working on dropping videos specifically for the African market. for instance how Africans see cryptocurrency is a bit different from  how the western world see it.In Africa we preach about being your own bank, ability to spend the credits everywhere, the fight is still  between fiat and cryptocurrency, full of peer to peer, using it to received remittances sometimes for export and import transactions therefore the marketing message we put across should be different even though the basics must be the same we shall therefore used existing  marketing materials and also add new ones that are tailored for the African market.
5. concerning hurdles to be accepted as medium exchange i cannot say all barriers are removed in Ghana but its in the process let me drop some news links that justify that Ghana is one of the countries in Africa that is ready to make laws for cryptocurrency regulations https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Cryptocurrency-Advocates-push-for-swift-laws-by-BoG-686117#

https://www.africa.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-africa-slowly-picking-up-the-pace/
even though there are no laws regulating it there are also no laws prohibiting it. even though it will be difficult convincing a number of them to accept it as medium exchange our main target its to provide them with the neccessary information and eduction so that when crypto is regularize they have no options that to choose deCRED. even then companies shops among others can choose to accept it as medium of exchange provided they have correct information and education. we have few shops down here that accept bitcoin. these are clarities i can make for now i will add more as time goes on.

First contributer i contacted since i started this activities for deCRED i appreciate your support and the guidance you have given me up to this level. Yes i can confidently say that i have worked with DASH as an ambassador before. That made me had a lot of experience when its comes to cryptocurrency ecosystem in Africa and Ghana to be precise. i have attend several conferences, radio talk show, events, meetups and had also organized some myself. Conflict of interest? i wiill say no, it started like, this is in early 2017 that i started doing cryptocurrency then i realized i really enjoyed using btc as compared to normal currency.(great advantage over fiat) because my father who was in Turkey was sending me remittances to my phone through btc which was easier, cheap and simpler as compared to western union. i started talking to people about btc and decided  to research more into it because i realize am lonely in this field and can also arguably changed the financial system in Ghana if much attention is pay to it. is through my research that i found DASH. Because i have learned a lot about cryptocurrency i was chosen by a Nigerian  DASH ambassador who submitted a proposal building a DASHYAfrica to work as an ambassador for Ghana.Through one blockchained conference somebody mentioned deCRED claiming he doesn't know the different between the two before then i have never head of deCRED. i research into the project then i realized this is where i belong since then i started preaching about deCRED.
Secondly the research was than this way. we visited all exchanges both physical and online  we realized none of them ,has deCRED been listed. In Ghana telegram and whatsapp is also used as p2p platform of all the p2p platform we are in nobody  has mentioned of  selling deCRED before its always btc Dash and ethereum. To ten people gathered in Ghana 7 of them knew about bitcoin the remaining 3 have zero knowledge about btc this reseaerch was done through observing and asking questions and also through crypto and non crypto events i have attended. we then concluded that 70% of Ghanaians know btc in fact this is true since there are shops that accept btc in Ghana.
concerning why we included merchants we realized that one problem that could hinder businesses from accepting deCRED is lack of merchant that will directly buy the dcr and changed to fiat for them  without first converting to btc to avoid fees charged by exchanges like changelly and shapeshift since if that happen it could affect their initial capital due to high fees charged in converting dcr to btc. Merchants are included so that we can  build a complete ecosystem in Ghana where everybody benefits.

Can you explain this line item on your budget, George?

Are you expecting us to pay $5600 for printing Smart Cash Tshirts? 

One plausible explanation for this is that your are such a dumb and lazy &*% $%#$%# that you pushed the same darn proposal to some other crypto and copy pasted it here. You  look like a scammer to me if this is true.

 Respectfully, i dont want to boast with the kind of project i have embarked on for the dash community and the other team members for smartcash (the images for instance we sent with the previous comment was one of our team members who used to work for smart cash and the people he was standing with were managing directors Ghana brewery marketing consult in the Western region) we want to work for decred to prove our worth with full length video of every activity we undertake in the project and the first milestone will marvel the decred community.
With our experience, we believe that cryptocurrency is the way, there are a lot of other things we plan to do which was not captured in the proposal. We are ready to travel the length and breadth of Ghana and the whole of Africa to preach decred. 
I never even imagined to scam dash even when i had premeditated on leaving for another project.
There are a lot of used case for cryptocurrency in Africa, we therefore need your support and the entire community to make decred the number one cryptocurrency in Ghana and subsequently create an ecosystem in Africa.","35084dfd25bea90cced8c583920d6ecb7ef7a9c5e48d3e8fef67989dbe947406d79ccc05fef54315f0802195ea6293468f6509111ed33c6ec0215bd557ae9502","205f28e751f08b4f8bbb42667f01c68664d1bf4b3e8f7adc4fb0edf8e51d2098","13","620918691fa21bdb65bb0ec1786e5579edd4cd308b62cb0948ed3345399afcb339eb1b20a69096fa6976c3d2af3d6a1ba902622c61da19ae2e8bc8df71df1d00",1553381145,0,0,FALSE,NA,"dac06f18bfeb5f7667e56554774de3bb99151018ce16a64f5353bab45819763b/comments/13",NA,NA,12,11,9,NA

       @degeri thanks for showing concern in this proposal. First contributor I contacted since I started this activity for decred, I appreciate your support and the guidance you have given me up to this level. Yes, I can confidently say that I have worked with Dash as an ambassador before. That made me had a lot of experience when it comes to cryptocurrency ecosystem in Africa and Ghana to be precise. I have attended several conferences, radio talk show, cryptocurrency seminars, meetups and had also organized some myself. Conflict of interest? I will say no, it started like this. It is in early 2017 that I started getting involve in cryptocurrency then I realized I really enjoyed using btc as compared to normal currency (great advantage over fiat). My father who was in Turkey was sending me remittances to my phone through btc which was easier, cheap and simpler as compared to western union. I started talking to people about btc and decided to research more into it because I realize am lonely in this field and it can also arguably change the financial system in Ghana if much attention is pay to it. Is through my research that I found Dash. Because i have learned a lot about cryptocurrency I was selected by a Nigerian Dash ambassador who submitted a proposal building a DASHYAfrica to work as an ambassador of Dash for Ghana. Through one blockchain conference somebody mentioned decred claiming he doesn't know the different between the two, before then I have never heard of decred. I research into the project then I realized this is where I belonged. Since then I started preaching about decred. 
    Secondly the research was than this way. we visited all exchanges both physical and online we realized none of them, has decred been listed. In Ghana telegram and whatsapp is also used as p2p platform, of all the p2p platform we are in nobody has mentioned of selling decred before it is always btc, Dash and ethereum. We also got to know that to 10 Ghanaians gathered 3 of them know about bitcoin and the remaining 7 have zero knowledge about btc we therefore concluded that 70% of Ghanaians don't know about btc since to every 10 people is almost certain that only 3 know about btc. This research was done through observing, asking questions and also after attending and organizing crypto and non-crypto events, this in fact is very true since we have some shops that accept btc as medium of exchange. Concerning why we included merchants we realized that one problem that could hinder businesses from accepting decred is lack of merchant that will directly buy the dcr and changed to fiat for them without first converting to btc to avoid fees charged by exchanges like changelly and shapeshift since if that happen it could affect their initial capital due to high fees charged in converting dcr to btc. Merchants are included so that we can build a complete ecosystem in Ghana where everybody benefits. The other three core members with their social media accounts are provided below:

   Thanks for showing concern in this proposal @gravity. I will love to answer your question base on how it is numbered and structured. Is unfortunate the detailed budget we included in the proposal was private. We are sorry for the inconvenience we have cause to you and the whole community, this is the link to the detailed budget  which is not private;  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8.              
  1. Concerning preamble, it is not something we were hiding we even mentioned paxful CEO and also the website to clearly show that we copied. However some items in it clearly  show that we did not lazily copy as you are saying. For example we included #endbankingfraud in the preamble,  is through our research that we found out that through twitter a bunch of Africans are showing their dislike for the current banking system due to gross and minor fraud they are encountering individually. So to say it was lazily copied is something that baffled me. We did a lot of research moving from website to website then we came about that information about Africa. We wanted the community to have an overview on how Africa is and the current state of the continent. We copied but to say we lazily copied is somehow too strong to me. The image is quite clear over here it shocks us that it is a bit blurry after uploading. May be the quality was reduced after uploading it. All links concerning wherever we took some vital information from will be added to the proposal soon. We thought the community don't need them so we excluded most of them. 
   2. concerning time frame, it is properly proportional to the work and the ambitions we want to achieved we shall add time-line and milestone to the proposal and all that ambiguity will be solved. Thanks for recognizing our work but if you say amateurish work, I agree with you some of the events we organized pictures was taken by our phone which make the work somehow look amateur but a lot went into it during and after the organization. 1. getting proper venue 2. collaboration with other events organizers, in some situation we have to pay money before we are allowed to speak 3. there are some situations that we spoke under certain events that we did not post on any community platform at all because we realized the community will say we are doing amateur work, there are situations enquiry desk was set at events for participant to ask question concerning decred but we never share on slack the pictures look amateur after the events. Pictures of such events will be post soon. Concerning budget sorry for the privacy of the sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DK84SJcsxY6XgiJh3XMabhCjDv5dvEmhGEtOVSQDc8 check it. It will convinced you that the budget is not high and that it follows the plans and the things we budgeted for.
    3. In case of social media we are still working on dropping videos specifically for the African market. for instance, how Africans see cryptocurrency is a bit different from how the Western world see it. In Africa we preach about being your own bank, ability to spend the credits everywhere, the fight is still between fiat and cryptocurrency, full of peer to peer, using it to received remittances sometimes for export and import transactions, therefore the marketing message we put across should be different even though the basics must be the same we shall therefore use existing marketing materials and also add new ones that are tailored for the African market.
   5. concerning hurdles to be accepted as medium of exchange I cannot say all barriers are removed in Ghana but it’s in the process let me drop some news links that justify that Ghana is one of the countries in Africa that is ready to make laws for cryptocurrency regulations https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/Cryptocurrency-Advocates-push-for-swift-laws-by-BoG-686117#
https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/business/BoG-assures-provision-of-regulations-to-support-blockchain-innovations-706509 https://bitcoinafrica.io/2019/02/06/ghana-cryptocurrency-regulation-sec/ https://www.africa.com/cryptocurrency-regulation-africa-slowly-picking-up-the-pace/ Even though there are no laws regulating it there are also no laws prohibiting it. Even though it will be difficult convincing a number of businesses to accept it as medium of exchange our main target is to provide them with the necessary information and education so that when crypto is regularize, they have no option that to choose decred. Even before then, companies, grocery shops, malls among other businesses can choose to accept it as medium of exchange provided, they have correct information and education. We have few shops down here that accept bitcoin. 
 6. On referral system, the prizes, rewards and all other benefits are budgeted for, they are clearly found in the detailed budget. 
These are clarities I can make for now I will add more as time goes on.

Although I would like to see a greater Decred presence in Ghana and Africa, this proposal does not appear to be genuine and is instead an opportunist cash grab.

I can emphatically say that how Africa see cryptocurrency is different from how other continent see cryptocurrency. We are not saying we won’t preach decred as store of value but we realize decred can solve other problems like high underbanked and unbanked population, high fees in remittances receiving, poor peer to peer transactions and corruption. Why not change the message to suit the economy of the various continent to solve the problems each continent is facing. Maybe other continent need decred as store of Value which is the primary goal of decred, but maybe other continents also needs decred in another form that does not mean the people promoting it over there are ignoring the primary goal of decred but rather being creative and dynamic. Should we forget decred ability to be used to receive remittances? Should we forget decred ability as making peer to peer transactions easy? So you mean we shouldn’t talk about its ability to be a medium of exchange? What of the 70 percent underbanked and unbanked population in Africa? we shouldn’t tell them they can be their own bank through decred, what of those who have lost trust in the current financial system we shouldn’t tell them decred is offering them the best form of financial system you mean we should ignore all the above and primarily preach decred as store of value? Do critical research into the decred project very well, you will realize that the project is for Africa a lot of use case to make decred a cryptocurrency of value. Here is the case we are lagging behind due to lack of enough education and outreach about decred. Store of value is the main goal we strongly agree but there other financial system problems and challenges decred can solve to make decred a cryptocurrency with utility and that’s what we are doing. 
We plead with the community to support this grassroot project improving technology is good but raising the standards of living in some countries through decred is an awesome and great activity for this great cryptocurrency project(decred). For decred being use as store of Value, it  can easily be achieved when other factors are rightly in place. It’s not that the decred Ghana team have no in depth knowledge about the project (I studied this project for 3 month before I started doing meetup and to attend events in the name of decred) but we believed for the credits to be used as **store of value** then we have to make sure  (decred) first have value in the Ghana economy and Africa at large. If they will use it as medium of exchange, if Merchants are ready to exchange dcr to fiat and fiat to dcr, if majority of exchanges in Africa list decred, when decred is integrated into various cryptocurrency and blockchain platform, when majority of the cryptocurrency community in Africa now use decred, when decred now have a lot of use cases in Africa. Using it as store of value will happen organically and automatically. Because decred will become a cryptocurrency with utility and real value.

First of all this is a very ambitious plan. People familiar with the project would agree this is not the usual way how decred approach things. 

Ditto is well established and well connected setup and yet their props took quite some effort to pass. 

IMO i would say 
- Start with the smaller and lower cost items. 
- Start with one/two event instead of packaging it to a 3 mths commitment. 
- Drop the airdrop/free $ idea. That is not the only way to fuel adoption in fact i think its inapproriate to fuel adoption with that. 
- I also think that smaller items costing less than couple hundred can slide under events / marketing budget which should be a better way to prove quality of your work. 

The fact is there are lots of scams around cryptospace, I dont know for sure if you are one of them but for sure decred is very cautious and serious about governing and protecting the funds. 

I will vote No to what i see at the moment but dont take that personally. Whatever happen to the proposal i hope you stay with the community and continue contributing and i wish you all the best with the props.

Why not change the message to suit the economy of the various continent to solve the problems each continent is facing. Maybe other continent need decred as store of Value which is the primary goal of decred, but maybe other continents also needs decred in another form that does not mean the people promoting it over there are ignoring the primary goal of decred but rather being creative and dynamic.

A possible solution is to have a special type of testnet DCR (tDCR) which you will be free to distribute which is fundamentally worthless now. These 'marked' tDCR could become redeemable for mainnet (real) DCR sometime in future (subject to vote).

In the meantime, the tDCR having no real value will allow you to demonstrate the technology and not be accused of being a scammer by the larger community. It will also lead to increased attacks on the testnet due to the lower hash rate protecting it which is great for the community as a whole as it will allow the testnet to be tested more thoroughly!

It will also provide many individuals in Africa with the tools to barter/trade safely which is the whole point of this exercise IMHO.

Finally, I'm sure many of us who have obelisks sitting as doorstops would be willing to donate hash power to helping secure the testnet if this crazy comment comes to fruition.","9318b1bc42b137c5d509f832b0cacb489b13e533086045c1c47684d638e05af3f5826e51051576438d448ede572d1e741b8d4989fb40e2c3527eecaa1a905a0b","5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","43","a5adef64f7ae486a774ef48895557764e620369d41abd69c7e6f33e8200359377af8cd704fe988206124ea5e05997778745d4fc3cc3fcc20b6f9cd8dece4c304",1554526820,0,0,FALSE,NA,"dac06f18bfeb5f7667e56554774de3bb99151018ce16a64f5353bab45819763b/comments/43",NA,0,0,0,0,0

IMO, we are still in the collectible phase and focusing on payments and merchant adoption now is a waste of time for 2 reasons:

1) Decred is still too volatile to be a good medium of exchange

There's no way I'm voting to pay out $1M+ up front, this is going to need to be paid bit-by-bit with milestones of development.

You've listed various developer pay rates, but it looks like a significant portion of the work will be done at $25/hr. I'm a bit skeptical of quality work being performed at that pay rate.

Also, as per https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4, it is my understanding that developers (at least those working on Decredition) will need to obtain a DCC. Are you prepared for this?

On a technical side; I quote:

> Decredex is totally decentralised - no central authority.

Yet you mention integration with MasterCard, NASDAQ, and other centralized platforms. Please explain in detail; ""decentralized"" is becoming a buzzword that means different things to different people.

- Are you planning on using atomic swaps for crypto exchanges?
- How are you doing the order book?
- Are you using an escrow/arbitrator system for fiat exchange?
- You mentioned KYC; how does this tie into this ""decentralized"" system?","6461d8ee6306571ec6b35dc181681b86c2e0f3fc9737fb12c26cd71700d30d75c727933c25d9a60f37a4da5a31d0cce1be23eef0a0f105b096d24bb13563d100","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","2","ee346f43e97c5921f816f675c510a25f9464ef97befe8a86d364b632f0946a6bd26dca7b221160d76e22bb6f5a74793217ce3d83372a091892a76edf9246f109",1543417952,0,0,FALSE,NA,"e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc/comments/2","ryanzim",NA,19,19,8,NA

He was enthusiastic, had a lot of buzzword-y things to say, and was told about the process to become a contractor for the project.  In the months since then, he and other REUM staff have made zero effort to become contractors.  As such, we have no experience with their work product, and it seems clear they are not interested in engaging with the existing contractor community.

That said, I see a number of things that are alarming with this proposal.  To avoid being sucked into making an epic and detailed reply to this proposal, I will post my criticisms as a set of succinct bullet points:

* REUM and its staff have made no real effort to engage the existing project contractors or the wider community prior to this proposal.
* REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.
* REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
* Creating a functional DEX is a technical project.  Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.
* This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.
* The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
* The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.
* Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project.  The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
* The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.
* The proposed timeline is unrealistic.
* Creating a proposal based on an idea and simply pointing at some dev shops when it comes to the implementation runs contrary to the spirit of the project.  The purpose of our proposal system is not to fund ""shower thoughts"".","fb130b2813b292b22d67569f616772e9d83d2effda2dacb6aef39543225ecb797c8e807dba28d775d0e223093880520c50049aaa28f6bdf22e40a2849113e806","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","4","77715914b9df68069f1dd861930d3f45d2bf5eb61be16b92a35d7cacea671c54caa42acaebe7a3b7eb02d33e5386a1ce77600fee8a2511a1258da2d3def6b208",1543422922,0,0,FALSE,NA,"e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc/comments/4","jy-p",NA,30,29,9,NA

Decred currently has no exchange, thus no way of sharing DCR with other blockchains, crosschain technology and wallet to wallet transactions, which our developers can provide, will go a long way to providing Decred with a closer relationship with consumers, securing the coins future which is decentralised but also inclusive.

The Mastercard program is a 'closed loop' debit card, meaning it can only be used with Decred (DCR), but can be used to purchase products in store, not to extract cash from an ATM, it is decentralised by nature, because it is essentially an extension of DCR embedded into a card.

as stated in last comment, I have been very busy and did attempt to engage, but time meant I was unable to keep up with all communications, although I did stay up on as much as i could.

    REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.

OK, I have no answer for this, as we have not had a chance to show or prove anything, obviously not looking like we will get this chance, willing to build Decredex in the way we stated and prove it is possible.

    REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
    Creating a functional DEX is a technical project. Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.

Currently building (as project managers) for several organisations, including other currencies and some of the larger exchange businesses, can show you these projects as they are developed, established then launched, again I can see Decred has a way of doing things, was planning to place a developer and communication staff member on to the project, if I had got positive feedback, but Democracy is what is, so the check and balances have found me as not capable, I guess I need to look at myself a little in this instance. 

    This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.

I can back up every 'buzzword' with facts, but again please be specific I will rebuttal each point constructively and concede where I must concede.

    The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
    The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.

I am in talks with Nasdaq and will be hiring them to provide trade security and compliance, I am head of Europe at http://moentum.com which is SEC Approved, so ready to discuss my Mastercard https://www.prosper2.co.uk/ and Nasdaq https://business.nasdaq.com/market-tech/ contacts in detail if you wish, I have several executive connections, this is why I did not have time in the forums and social networks, I was speaking with enterprises! 

    Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project. The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
    The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.

The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.

The permissions element was for DCR OTC services KYC/AML, the actual DEX would be metamask enabled, so yes fully decentralised.

Surely they could have provided more technical details, if they have been working on it for 8 weeks already? There are no technical specs, not even which programming languages they are planning to use.

One paragraph in the ""How"" section of the proposal did it for me:

In the ""How"" section you are supposed to explain _how_ you are going to implement the proposal. This paragraph contains the message ""we need the Decred community to tell us what to do, because we don't have the required knowledge / skills to build this DEX ourselves""

I asked for an explanation ""in detail""; a single hyphenated word is not ""in detail.""

I am a developer, I can understand technical terms. You mentioned elsewhere that you're not a developer, I understand that, get a developer that will be working on the project to explain stuff then. 

- Is there a single centralized order book server?
- Is the order book managed by a federation of servers?
- Can anyone run their own order book server?
- Or is the order book fully p2p?

Not sure what you're trying to say; let me give an example to clarify my question:

Alice has USD and wants to buy DCR from Bob with her USD. Now, how does Alice pay her USD to Bob? Directly, or is there an intermediary? What prevents Bob from keeping both the USD and DCR? Or, if Bob sends the DCR first, what prevents Alice from getting the DCR and never sending the USD?

1. Not nearly every cryptocurrency has its own exchange.

But there is little details on the: financial objectives, business strategy, organizational structure, relations with and obligations to DCR, expectations and goals, etc or even what branch is it expected to live one. 

Would consider any real meat on this, if the investment asked would have good returns balancing out the risks, e.g. how much of your business would DCR own and how can that be solved legally (if it even can be done)? How quickly would you pay back the investment from DCR treasury and in what terms would this generate revenue towards DCR treasury? 

Certainly don’t see it becoming the next Binance or Coinbase. These ships have sailed. Neither is it a decentralised exchange or competing with those in production. What bothers me the most is the real term “decentralised exchange” not being respected here. As if it’s tied to fiat, credit card services etc then by no means can you call it a decentralized exchange. 

If the likely outcome is another low-tier exchange, would be a waste of project funds imo. I see no point in competing with rest of them and can expect huge risks considering how much trust and security issues these various smaller exchanges have in their track record. E.g. this being super close under the Decred umbrella – gets hacked or business goes bad = very bad rep for DCR. Personally I think there are enough of these fishy exchanges that do no favours to the whole cryptospace.

- 4 devs at 25$/h with this scope and schedule seems deeply questionable regarding the weight of responsibility. If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.
- Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.
- Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?
- On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage. 
- Naming/Communication: Decredex – knowing Company Zero has put out earlier post of an upcoming DEX proposal, why even pick such a competing and conflicting name?","2c11b34a5c2ab02fc33f662bfe21d7fdcaa754f09c47eaefbc47ea353922987d02a36a2e56b95763fe88f6dcb5e7fd4b276212e1497032b67f18bd3049e56105","c4936b1db0f0fdbaa1c4271bc5d9382452b85f5bb15df75ea45c8d70a46cb2dc","34","3480bb608111150ab31ff3f42e9a15a2bafd7bddb577e9927c7dd78e42e1b84fbf64040b3b3fd122108406e3d4c164f3692f07f5c2ce17975a81c99c4835ca05",1543586610,0,0,FALSE,NA,"e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc/comments/34",NA,NA,17,15,10,NA

We would offer the Decred organisation 100% of all the revenue, thus proving ourselves over a long term period, we are a small group so it would be difficult to communicate consistently with the community while building the DEX, we left out GUI element from the budget request, as we can provide this element in house.

business strategy:

it is just a part of our plans to grow into an exchange service provider, which will bring us enterprise level clients, to build their exchanges revenue and business is paid up-front for exchange delivery, then the buyer keeps all exchange trade profits and arbitrage fees revenue.
 
organizational structure:

REUM Ltd, based in the UK, as a project management team alongside some external developers.

relations with and obligations to DCR, 

To introduce a REUM tech and communication staff members to engage Decred and to join as a contractor and to walk through all of the rules of engagement with Decred, we are conceding on this proposal, but we will come back positively and prove our worth to Decred.

If they are doing the work on the side, you should provide proof of trackrecord and competence. Who are they, CV's? Quality blockchain devs are scarce, so otherwise without proof it may be whoever, juniors or outsourced indian devs just chopping something together.
    Combined 245k on marketing/pr before having an actual product is way out of balance (almost 45% of dev budget), and in conflict with DCR’s ethos on actually building the products first.
    Reference from reum.io/brand-agency – is a kind of marketing approach I personally find repulsive and completely unfitting for anything serious in the financial sector altogether. Keeping in mind DCR’s more conservative approach on marketing and general attitude towards the ICO boom, i’d imagine you should be well aware how conflicting this is?
    On the same time there is no budget allocated for design and UX. Big red flag, considering this is a far more important factor than marketing/pr. Only need good design and good communications at this stage.

I am not perfect myself, but I'd implore you to deploy empathy & think harder about the human at the other end of your keyboard. I think it's pretty apparent that we have a full team who have all put immense effort into the project to date and for you to suggest that we think Decred is a charity we can just sign up for when we're ready to make it rain is a straw man argument at best. As you'll start to see on the vlog as episodes go up, we've been working on this proposal for ~two months. It would be much appreciated if folks could read the proposal thoroughly enough not to need to be informed of its contents later, after having already responded. I also think the juvenile nature the #proposals room in Slack exhibited was...surprising. It was unbecoming of the team, and not what I would expect from the only crypto network with working on-chain governance in production. (since 2013!!)

We're here in good faith to take and integrate feedback because we believe in the ethos of Decred, too! I can certainly appreciate a bit of sticker shock; making games is expensive! We really think that setting an example for the games industry to turn their gaze our way will propel Decred & the entire crypto ecosystem further forward at faster pace than we've seen to date. As I say in the proposal, a high tide raises all ships: we are stronger when we work together! We do not consider ourselves a private business any more than Company Zero was at Decred's inception, and we intentionally only referenced the Airdrop & Fairdrop plans, imagining myriad more models would be suggested by the community as some helpful folks have!

We've found when studying the crypto space in macro that games are how the rest of the world is looking toward the space to prove its worth and spur mass adoption. (everyone here knows sound money is reason enough, but most need more than that) Some game developers are interested, but the space is still so nascent that many of the major concepts are still so obtuse, and games don't yet support or even understand the infrastructure to support them. To reference [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant), [platforms follow the application](https://www.usv.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase). We have a long view; Baeond is dogfood for a larger Proof of Play protocol that we anticipate will enable industry veteran game designers to create permissionless & autonomous games. We're here for the long haul and think Decred is the wagon to hitch to.

We possess an agility Decred does not when it comes to experimentation, so we're looking to join forces and grow alongside, not unlike how MimbleWimble/Grin has been handling [forks](https://mw-w.ink/leer/index.php/flavors/). Someone in the Slack made the comparison to this prop effectively being a satellite dev team Decred would be funding, and yes! That's exactly the ticket! We don't see any value in shouting at the team to support features we'd need for a game & we don't see a lot of promise in other base layer projects just yet. The space is ripe for experimentation! We want to help start a more nimble arm of development around Decred. We really don't think anything could be healthier for the Decred network at this stage in time. 

For now, I'm updating the prop to reflect an ask of 11K $DCR disbursed over 7 months. I'm working on a quick writeup for the end of the week on some of the specifics of we're doing to support LN swaps with DCR, NFT support, a Politeia facelift/UX breakdown(Hi, design team, if you're reading! I'll be reaching out to you on Github soon!), and a few very new, very untested ideas we look forward to putting through their paces.

However,  asking the Decred stakeholders for funding is not a good idea at all. I believe many recent proposals exhibit the same issues as this one.

The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).

The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

At the moment, the primary question that anyone who want to make a proposal should ask beforehand IMO is:  Who is the primary beneficiary of this proposal? ""  If the answer is not Decred or the Decred ecosystem, or the Decred Community,  expect strong opposition from stakeholders..

That's how I view the treasury and its purpose. That being said,  I could envision within a few years, when things are going nicely and we have a better picture of our treasury and operation costs, a proposal being made to set aside a small % of the treasury specifically in a separate fund that itself,  could be used to allocate grants, donations, or to fund various ventures like this one. 

But it's way too early for that, and way to risky.

While Baeond may end up being a very cool game, I don't see how it directly benefits the project, beyond it integrating DCR support at a later date.  There is no existing network or service, so this is effectively funding an idea/vaporware nearly from scratch.

Historically, the project has only financially supported development of open source software.  Will this game be entirely open source?  That is unclear to me after carefully reading the proposal.  Funding closed source software development creates serious transparency problems since work cannot be verified prior to payment of monthly invoices.

I think it's neat that they plan to use DCR's hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm as the basis for their chain.  However, I find the entire ICO model to be questionable, both ethically and legally, and by funding this proposal, we would become entwined with it, per ""after the crowdsale next year"".

Others have voiced this same concern: it is not clear what Decred gets in exchange for DCR 11K (previously 13K) in funding (roughly USD 200K).  It appears that the promise of Baeond coins being airdropped to DCR users is the main return from this investment, but I see no quantification of how many coins would be airdropped.  Further, the model here appears to be ""in exchange for objects with established value (DCR), I want to sell you a promise"".  I see little utility in using the Decred Treasury to fund such VC-like dart-throwing, and we have limited recourse in the case they do not deliver on their end of the deal, i.e. the airdrop.","5ba6f1b49fceb70f36f022471aa647fd93a2d11657ed9f7ba5f827ff00038ceef9701f687021fc41dd166b991d55062d0ad705dc490fb7da3c4d9af86cd7b105","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","16","d12d15a4d81a8baf26e293055bf3d0e8bb1a1ab74f8b81b3256d54bf281c40ebb50f22046a1b2857269c2c35140a0914b92fd4d2bd6dc57f1169a98c2e9ae307",1546435917,0,0,FALSE,NA,"f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/16","jy-p",NA,17,17,8,NA

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean every different wallet that has held at least one voting ticket throughout Decred's history?

I don't think Decred stakeholders will vote for a proposal that aims to pay individual stakeholders back with card packs, in any case. The Treasury is not an investment fund and payments are not intended to generate a return for stakeholders.

Baeond seems like a cool game and it would be great to see you develop it using Decred as a foundation. It is not something the Decred Treasury should fund, in my opinion, because it asks for a significant sum of DCR to do things that are not well connected to the project's objectives, and which are unlikely to deliver significant value in that regard. $200k moonshots are not the kind of signal stakeholders should be sending about the (still young) Treasury's aspirations. 

If there really is overlap between what Baeond and Decred want to build, Treasury funding for work that directly benefits both projects could be something to explore later on.","2ca9fdce7b47325c6b9d9759397d9c0830f689bec68d271c57dae3c628130db2e746fb4fefdbe368c3af28cd888920e242310f1fdcca50556001eb407649df0a","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","22","7c554dabab90e550287a85a2a60927d322cb535e5189ae07cf137ae9c041dadb503391e49862fc0cd548983ac17c255a0fcef76520a23828e0cc22a7a6927408",1546909633,0,0,FALSE,NA,"f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/22","richard-red",NA,10,10,8,NA

It will mean we have to get more formal about identifying domains and who is active in which one. That seems like a useful thing to track publicly anyway.

But I also understand the question being raised regarding smaller contributions.

Let's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.

Could maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC? Or maybe we could have a special repo for smaller and new initiatives where people can submit their already completed work without having the DCC?

Regarding voting fatigue, someone could manage payments in this ""special"" repo each month. Itself becoming the proposal for the sum of the contributions seen as valuable.

Also, this raise the question of what would happen if someone submit a small proposal for already completed work, for which the community is highly in favor, but the developer behind it has no DCC, and maybe no experience to contribute in existing repos?

I am in full support of it, the only question I have is about the number of contractors required to grant or take a DCC. Would it work if we set a more dynamic number, perhaps via percentage of contractors, of a specific subdomain? My worry is only that revoking someone's DCC usually creates controversy so we must be certain that it will be seen as a legitimate action.

You wrote:

This is exactly my worry, that it would be 3 people who are of the same entity. Does ""ideal"" mean it will be just hoped for, as opposed to enforced? Enforcing this would be difficult. 

So my question is, would you be open to the idea of experimenting with a different number or perhaps a percentage, as opposed to a fixed number 3? And what was the rationale behind arriving at that number?

1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics & corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.

2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:
   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:
   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.
  
  On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.
3. > These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.
  
  That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.
4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.
  
  This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.

  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.","2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e",1540044035,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/12","ryanzim",NA,21,21,8,NA

1. As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.

For example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.

**From proposal:**

> It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.

In my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. 

If left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.

2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.
Having 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.

For example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.

3. Sub-Contractors
I totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.

4. Stakeholders
Ultimately, some decisions will go to stakeholders for a final approval as we may not be able to resolve by internal voting.

Overall, this is a step in the right direction an I'm looking forward to more comments and ideas.

1. Every system is vulnerable to politics and corruption.  This proposal is an attempt to make staffing for the project not require my or any other project oracles' involvement.

2. The extent to which soft skills factor into this varies across subdomains.  Historically, we really don't care much about language skills so long as people can adapt to feedback and work constructively within their subdomain.

3. If a corporate contractor is found to be engaging in contractor vote manipulation, the punishment can be determined by an all-contractor vote.  I obviously can't speak for other corporate contractors besides Company 0, but I am really keen to stay out of these kinds of conflicts and let the individuals duke it out.

4. Regarding cartel behavior, which has been shown to be emergent in some systems, or other collusive behavior, this is exactly why I proposed the ability to escalate this to a proposal for stakeholders to vote on.  The scenario you describe is roughly what has happened with Bitcoin, but I have also seen some legitimately bad code that merits scrutiny.  If the stakeholders can be fooled into buying into arguments that boil down to an appeal-to-authority, we have more serious problems than the DCC model.","7d048c7a1370a542813b6b68ca82f489e7ce7c226973167e0c97a8189f9a2cb603264b48cabdc372f4956e5b6c969961505b4833e6411e948a130ba7b5199408","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","21","961111bf90090fcef40b552242e2b6fdfe475582bcc68bf114d7be6742e4994fda81b6b23480ea4ce0dc46324a91df3e6edc0be5a205b65552c3592f86257007",1540069072,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/21","jy-p",NA,16,16,8,NA

In several cases, outright termination was the only real option for contractors who were overbilling and under-delivering.

1. Per my response to ryanzim, every system can be gamed.  There is an escalation process that can address punitive or self-interested actions.  The current system where I mediate these conflicts, or where they are mediated by some other person or group, are also vulnerable to gaming.  Even in the design subdomain where you do some of your work, there are several groups performing work, not just one entity.  This diversity applies to most subdomains, AFAICR.  Corporate contractors only having a single vote creates a substantial incentive against being a corporate contractor, whereas every individual DCC holder being able to vote reflects the skin-in-the-game more accurately.

2. Regarding working in multiple subdomains, I think that it could make sense to allow for a DCC to apply to one or more subdomains, and partial revocations to occur.  It would also make sense for a multi-subdomain contractor to be allowed to vouch in their corresponding subdomains, but their all-contractor vote would be handled the same way as everyone else's.

3. I'm glad you see the value of the subcontractor DCC, as I've dealt with this already and found it quite frustrating.","2305735873bb504f2ba06eaad2e2ca34f0da62e75023d7c86d3ef5d8414f381906747b31ff50073704829fd42f5b0690e984eec831651016d0ad8e0a3a402e0d","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","22","690c7b15ba04f563cf1cd9d55ae8f02abbba7b40807223e6479514ac1b557b75e5c42d96437e9c44e0d8efa143aa12395dbc1216ec2a44d86a2dbb61a656e407",1540070268,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/22","jy-p",NA,16,16,8,NA

Given all else that has been discussed I'm guessing no, but this should be made explicit: the process of obtaining a DCC is different than joining one of the existing core development teams (from which you can bill and whose budget will be discussed in a different proposal) and/or getting approval for participation in a particular proposal which would allow the originating entity (either an independent contractor or a corporate contractor) to actually bill for that particular proposal.

My concern is making explicit the dynamics for development teams/companies, the goals of the DCC system in particular and, more broadly, the high level goals of Politeia and the DAE.

I should contextualize that I'm from a country with somewhat strong worker protection laws, in which it's expensive to hire, maintain and terminate worker contracts, any given company can be easily sued for (improper, even if non intentional) worker compensation and (usually) loses those suits. And in full disclosure, I'm also trying to bring in some new developers following the proposed format for the DCCs.

Therefore I'll use a hypothetical example to tease out some of these concerns: Development shop Alpha (that currently does not have DCC holding employees) wants to propose a given software. Let's assume the idea itself is sound, well accepted and the team is generally regarded as competent at a first glance.

So now, the team from Alpha will have to get DCCs in order for the proposal to be put up for voting. Alpha itself (assuming it's a standard consulting business) will bear the cost for the work performed by their employees while acquiring the DCC. These developers will then be eligible for participation in Alpha's proposal.

Now, will Alpha's devs be able to directly bill for work performed (outside the context of Alpha's proposal)? Or will there be a separate process from which they'll have to join one of the existing core teams (possibly incidentally terminating their employment contract with Alpha)?

I assume this sort of situation will only be answerable in time, as we get more experience with Politeia and evolve the DAE. 

But we should make it explicit if the system is designed to be contractor-centric (a dev getting a DCC while working for a corporate contractor is only granted it as it relates to that corporation's proposals) or DCC-holder-centric (once you get a DCC, it's personally yours whether you remain in the contractor that ""sponsored"" you or not - and corporate contractors should have that in mind when hiring, training and maintaining employees).","c1eb060d262206df4358f3febcd325d66f5739bc18752477684b2230478d806baf7f1b04af5d8f22680355e9ca6252013c824d741c804614cb2fda1fb3b04502","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","33","848c7e9bd0a381f0662e57545d858d6a4ce0fe197c07f715d77226dc7cc3de9dbc135d87c4cc6dd00b79461e63b6619ab647660ddaa676c78c19fae134790a06",1540211214,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/33","matheusd",NA,17,16,9,NA

3. I was just thinking it might be good to include a statement in the proposal condemning corporate vote manipulation and recommending a penalty be enforced.

  I realize we can't make this code-enforced, but I was thinking along the lines of how the Decred Constitution states the 21 million supply limit. There's nothing that actually prevents an on-chain vote from modifying that limit, but most stakeholders would be opposed to it since it runs contrary to the Constitution. Likewise, if we make a recommendation of penalizing corporate vote manipulation in this proposal, it's highly likely that an all-contractor vote (or stakeholder vote) will enforce this recommendation.","dd03dc7e55ef90539635b1b1e438d95e0d79c9812433699d6b25f768a27ed3df5d78f8f7ca4f2f87496fdb55d6cda2a835f62f7c1afc245f947de8fbeb09fd02","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","34","44633da62af91308893d0fc193e9a164cd4e6b56d3e9a2b0ef3ed8d026ab48a39b5aef2e2acf99c10e5d7cd8543c8b651efcc78b1295dfc5a2152654208b0603",1540247684,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/34","ryanzim",NA,11,11,8,NA

I like this proposal. The existing process (show up, do, apply), is great. It's how employment should work, IMO. However, it requires a large leap of faith on the part of potential contractors. People have to invest a significant amount of time and energy up front, with no guarantee of being paid. From Decred's perspective, this is totally reasonable. Prospective contractors require a significant investment from Decred, in the form of time and energy spent onboarding, reviewing work, training, etc., with no guarantee of getting valuable work in return. The current materials around becoming a contractor (docs, blogs, etc.) express all this very well, along with the ethos of the project. In the end, it worked out for me. I'm psyched to be able to commit more to the project. However, I can see how this process could exclude many talented people who either can't handle the higher levels of uncertainty, or who have fewer financial resources than I do. 

If there was a system like the one proposed, and it actually works as intended, I think my journey would have been less stressful, and probably more productive. I also like the idea of having more visibility into the hiring/firing process moving forward. Indeed, it's my first month. I could still not work out and not have my contract renewed (no hard feelings). But I would want to at least know why it didn't work out!

Related question: will existing contractors be automatically given a DCC? Or will there be some process for determining which existing contractors get DCCs?

My only concern is that this system becomes corrupted in ways other commenters have worried about. If this turned into office politics as usual, I'm out. However, I generally trust the project leads' deep understanding (theoretical and experiential) of governance, system design, and automation. And I think the Decred's general strategy of incremental rollout is wise and tested. E.g. I'm glad a human is still distributing funds from Pi for now. 

If this works, it could unleash huge productivity gains and make Decred an even more exciting experiment. I want to work in a DAE.","3a20d101a08abad2e8382ce14b583b63879f6bf6879d01bb54181f579c147fad80564290907284112bc6499a0f5a54653a440c7614995fd5412f5facbc592e07","5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","37","05eaafd117416f563336c48a604b292d1ce31a2933f308ae1b13f1575a2e7e59076d321d4237a518b2c8da19f0326b1f9ccdd33757b391dff73c390029fe2107",1540934971,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/37","s_ben",NA,15,14,9,NA

Stakeholders can't directly vote on contractors but they can defund anything they don't like. This is usually not the case for delegated democracies, where the voters cannot defund bad projects.

Another idea is that the DCC could be revoked by a stakeholder vote without waiting for proper escalation (3 contractor vote -> all contractor vote -> stakeholder vote), that could be blocked by a cartel. Is this possible in the DCC process, @jy-p? Soft skills boil down to whether an individual can work with existing contractors without damaging his or others' productivity. If his English is poor, but others understand him, are not too irritated and like his deliverables, that will work. If he uses explicit language or jokes on diversity, but nobody is offended and no productivity is lost, that will work. Even if a person is a total devil he can look for a semi-isolated corporate entity, work via a ""softening proxy assistant"", or start his own company where he is nice to stakeholders but yells at his subordinates. If a corporate entitiy tries to force its employees to vote a certain way, the employee as an individual will have to decide for himself. If he succumbs to employer order that goes against the benefit of stakeholders, he risks losing reputation and his DCC. The fact that DCC is granted to individuals as opposed to blurry companies is helpful here. Stakeholders are incentivized by their skin in the game to not be fooled by the developers, and any contractors in general. This is a fundamental human problem of delegation. When you're not an expert in domain X and you hire someone to do X for you, he can fool you.

To extend this time i will post a new proposal after 6 months. At this point it should be mentioned again that i don't intend to use the maximum budget! I'm currently assuming 20 minutes for adding an article (decred journal, decred digest, event-reports) with text formatting and pictures. At the moment it's expected that these articles will be available in 2 - 3 different languages. Decred contributors additionally write 4-5 articles per month, in rare cases they are also available in several languages. In addition, there are sporadic video interviews and podcasts from soundcloud. Realistically, i currently assume a maximum effective working time of 5-10 hours per month. In addition, there are server and infrastructure upgrades. Therefore, i keep a frame of 15 hours sufficient. I will only bill for the time i effectively work. So it could end up beeing less than this. I simply have to find out at this point.

The maximum budget is given because maybe there will be wishes for functional expansion in the future (stats page, timestamping service...) and act as a buffer for unexpected cases. Especially in combination with the marketing effords of the project there could be needs for cross-plattform campaigns. Maybe there could be need for a helping contributor hand on deadline deliverables. 

I will give my best to be efficient and keep my workhours low. I have always maintained this attitude towards the project and this will not change.

The placement of advertisements will not happen! No paid advertisements will be placed on the site in the future. If there are advertising banners, then only for project internal purposes and campaigns which are free for the project.

I could set a lump sum as it is done in other proposals. However, this does not correspond to my imagination, so i decided for an expense allowance after hours because i consider this to be fair.

I feel that lots of aggregation work is already done by Decred Journal. It contains all the recent articles, videos, podcasts and even relevant chats on comms platforms. This makes the utility of this site only marginal in that section.

On the other hand, i think this will lead to more individual content and take off some load from bee's shoulders. My suggestion would be to update the proposal to list content from different contributors being aggregated e.g. Pi Digest, Haon's medium articles, Journal etc.

I like the mirroring of basic infrstructure services. To be sure, these will be independent instances of these services and not just links to the current instances, right?

You mention a Newsletter service, is this the same one that is proposed in [2019 Marketing Plan](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e)? If not is this not replication of same service and its costs? How will this be different?

Good to see, although voluntary and unpaid, translation work will be co-ordinated via the site.

Apart from above, I have three questions:

- Is this going to slowly replace Journal or both will keep working in parallel?

- What is meant by private and public photo gallery and areas of the site? can you explain with an example what these areas will be used for?

- Why can't this be added to main decred site under say community.decred.org? What are the benefits of doing a separate site?

Thanks for your work, looking forward to the updated proposal.

Access is granted to a selection of trusted contributors in the event of a failover/emergency. I would like 2-3 people who are able to make backups of the site and place content on it. Currently haon has access and he was introduced to working with the backend. If my response time asks for this situation due to an emergency or vacation, they should be able to tune in and post new content online. In this case they should be balanced out of this budget. What is important to me is that they are trustworthy and know what they are doing, what an introduction requires.

Writers are compensated by the Treasury and publish their articles on various platforms. I think if the project has paid for the production of this content, we should publish it on different platforms and not just keep it on individual platforms. I don't intend to manage the author's activities! I want to give them the opportunity to publish their content on this platform. Also for visibility and censorship resistance to what has happened in the past on the medium with crypto related content producers. I expect decred's main page to be more selective about the content they will publish, as the purpose of the main page is to inform and be more official. The purpose of this community page can be to give new people a chance to get a stance and establish in the project and a playground to try new things. The inspiration for this project came from zcsh and dsh, as they also run successful community outlets that attract engagement and displays healthy community activity.","0f37176978cab41faf0e6f6fe51c08d40a3283a1adc71e848932443ab51d3a711df6dbadd7ecbf2d798c58d1bb5ad60f5a9c34a3f67d8746b4457d978764d906","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","17","2303eb5b7502cac13d90f9827aba1008f545a0d2701dbbc0cbbcd6c9fc36f1c9d40e20ac7c3d8414a9ea016ce3cdd7649e1ff0f87a916bb07b439bf9b8ea9e03",1550980126,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/17",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

I have spoken with various contributors from the field, both in chats and on meetups. The idea was welcomed and I started working on the proposal a while ago.

The site should only serve as a platform for the output of the decred community. It should not replace anything, it should complement! It should inform and motivate new people to participate in the project. You should keep in mind that different target groups prefer different ways of presentation. Showing presence only on Github or the main page may not be enough.

Basically, every content financed by the treasury should find its place on the site, but not only that. Therefore I don't want to limit myself to certain sections (pi digest, haon, richardred, journal) (see section 'what'). There is no reason why these sections should not be supplemented in the future. Contributor profiles, author profiles, voices of individual stakeholders on certain topics, all the things that have no official character can find their place here.

Infrastructure, of course, are independent instances, this also emerges from the proposal (see 'ongoing budget'). We will use the ressources that the server has available for these.

Concerning the photo galleries I noticed that there are already a lot of pictures of conferences and meetings. These should be displayed clearly instead of being scattered on twitter. Visitors of the Meetups should have the possibility to find each other again. Regarding the privately accessible areas, there was a desire to provide materials especially for investors and the press.

The main page is informal. A horizontal diversification in the external presentation of the projects should enrich the ecosystem. As I said, I expect a rather conservative attitude from the main page in the future, the outsourced community page can only enrich here.

There are several possible approaches to the newsletter. Whether this is only used as a subscription for the official newsletter or whether additional content may also be played out here will have to be agreed with the marketing team.","e499b733aff81c652e0167f9724f32438ca2f6a9fd62d4a15543b15f39409263c3da40cd29955427ff898e7d3e5ed378c34558c216fa3a268906e25269d5db00","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","18","2e21d8c00b4e9f7fb72faeecdfc79f37e598104e8a8bc144686687e7c279188c116a3787b88f0cec4a215d519afe5a0d52a32f901379db4bbc045e9ac7f9900d",1550982697,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/18",NA,NA,10,10,8,NA

Can we maybe not waste all of our money on marketing stuff of all kinds? This is going to be a very unsustainable business model (even more when prices are low and nobody cares for crypto). I'd prefer to use it for real stuff and to convince people by awesome technology they are _seeking_ to use.

* Proposal presents a working prototype.
* The prototype looks solid and is immediately useful for all the content it has already organized.
* The fact that the author built the prototype upfront with his own money shows that he is passionate and will likely actively work on it in the future. This is in the spirit of Decred.
* The budget is fair, if not modest.
* Content tagged by People and other categories is a powerful way to navigate.
* Blog that aggregates multiple authors, video and audio, future events calendar and past events reports, list of merchants, architecture for multilingual content - are all long needed. I have a ton of designs for these, but they barely progress as drafts. Glad to see someone took it much further!

### Not liked

* The voting was rushed after just a few days of discussion. Combined with mostly secret development it gives very little time to think and discuss. Since the idea is sound, in case this voting round fails I suggest to not give up, adjust and try again.
* Web fonts abuse. With web fonts and SVG disabled all icons are missing. This is my personal thing, normal people don't have this problem.

### Questions

Tech:

* Is site code open?
* What software stack is used?

Knowledge preservation (my [obsession](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/archiving)):

* Can I clone and sync all site content?
* Can I selectively clone and sync only low-footprint textual articles?
* Can I run a mirror of the website?
* What formats are used to store content?
* Will it mirror video content from YouTube to protect it form destruction?
* Can it consume raw Markdown?
* Governance: how content is curated? Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?
* Track record: is content versioned?

Features:

* Is non-js experience high on the priority list?
* If this is paid by the Treasury, there will be no sponsored content, no ads and no third party user tracking, right?
* Will site usage stats/metrics be public info? Talking about aggregate, anonymized stats that can be collected without javascript on your self-hosted (first party) HTTP server.
* How private content works?
* Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?
* Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?
* Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content? 

Org:

* How long did it take to build the prototype (tech and content)?
* Do you know (have you negotiated with) people willing to curate content?
* What is the overlap with dcrweb (e.g. newsletter)? How do you envision cooperation with dcrweb? Any ideas to avoid duplicate work?


### Notes

* If anybody could spin a mirror of this website (see Knowledge preservation above), it removes most (if not all) centralization concerns.
* This has a lot of overlap with [dcrweb#561](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/561).
* [dcrweb#579](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/579) is applicable to community website too.
* The site can be built from multiple smaller data projects useful on their own, e.g. merchants data can live in its own repo and be consumed by the website's build process.","f26a035a7966734fbe495f500d960a92c2659862e9a9cbe057836077dc8d6d41cc341b0ec2f171f9a1616f2ad74b80214bea230274660a13fe767e31ec0b1704","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","54","7dbccbfb2544d249d82a0efaa059edcd97a54ba02425638bcaf501faed4f4b6ac88689246bc945770362620657f33958be97ab8bfd310b5befb017fc4e30f005",1551379195,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/54","bee",NA,12,11,9,NA

It is build on a open source cms, runs php and mysql

Knowledge preservation:
- *Can I clone and sync all site content?* 

No, only chance currently would be to download a static version or see next answer: 

```
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.org
```

- *Can I selectively clone and sync only low-footprint textual articles?*

Not yet but will be available via RSS

- *Can I run a mirror of the website?*

No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

-*What formats are used to store content?*

XHTML - has a rich-text-editor at the backend, no coding needed.

-*Will it mirror video content from YouTube to protect it form destruction?*

Thinkable but not planned. Each video would have to be served in 3 different file formats. Could be generated serverside with ffmpeg. A lot of storage would be needed, maybe an additional mediaserver would make sense in that case. From frontend side it already supports local served video, but is not in scope of my proposal.

- *Can it consume raw Markdown?*

Yes, converts to XHTML when storing in sql database.

- *Governance: how content is curated? Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?*

CMS backend editor. I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited, reviewed and published by admins/editors in the backend.

- *Track record: is content versioned?*

No. There is only a report on activity of the admins in the backend (what content/code section they touched when), but no versioning/old versions of the articles/changes.

Features:

- *Is non-js experience high on the priority list?*

Yes. Non-js experience at this point way better than dcrweb ux. But for some things js is mandatory, like video or soundcloud player, gallery- and slide effects.

- *If this is paid by the Treasury, there will be no sponsored content, no ads and no third party user tracking, right?*

Correct. Either way, there will never be tracking, sponsored adds or other kind of stupid things of this kind.

- *Will site usage stats/metrics be public info?*

I have deactivated all of this serverside. I am not interested in that crap. I would agree to embed piwik-visitor stats chunk of the decredproject. Marketing could work with that internaly, i have no access to this.

- *How private content works?* 

If there is need for this from the marketing team it could be available. Various approaches are thinkable. User login based with different access level/roles, or simply a simple single page password that protects content.

- *Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?*

Each single photo can have an individual title and description. Images are organized into photogalleries/folders, currently each event has one. I will work on the Event Detail page to show Event gallery, report, videos etc.

- *Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?*

Yes, supports RTL. From backend side no limitations on languages/lexicons. If at some point someone steps forward to redesign the page, an RTL version css for the frontend would have to be provided.

- *Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content?*

Prototype already supports this. https://decredcommunity.com/site-map Click on the RSS icon. Can be made available for every section granualy. After i am happy with the deliverable i would start to work on an RSS reader Android app. Got a concept in the drawers.


Org:

- *How long did it take to build the prototype (tech and content)?*

I realy have no idea at this point. I did it in my freetime and did not track my worktime. I started the concept back in November. The marketing proposal was a surprise and so i rushed a little to put the prototype proposal up.

- *Do you know (have you negotiated with) people willing to curate content?*

No negotiatons. Was getting help for the landing page from noah. Displayed the site in different stages to contributors i have met on meetups and discussed ideas. Others have already stepped forward to help with lexicon (site/lexicon/allaround navigation) translations.

I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited and reviewed by admins.

My plan is to work things out and create roles (content creator, editor, publisher) for different sections/translations on the backend side. After that there would be the need to create introduction videos on how to work in the backend for those different roles. By time it would be possible to grant more people restricted access to their area of work. This could be done once the site and their sections are build out but is a process to be planned in the future. At the current state it is simply a one-man job and my experience with scaled multilanguage cms based website is, there is a learning curve involved in working with the backend and you realy want to seperate creators/proof readers/editors/publishers(remove). Nontheless i will grant 2-3 people admin access for emergency purposes, like i already have mentioned. Having a solid multi-user/role setup takes planing and coordination. It is very granuarly. Therefore i want to build the site with functionality out and when i have streamlined it introduce new people potentially.

- *What is the overlap with dcrweb (e.g. newsletter)? How do you envision cooperation with dcrweb? Any ideas to avoid duplicate work?*

I am not planning to create newsletter content. I already answered that question, newsletter functionality is strong in the framework. It could be used to organize and publish newsletters, it could just be used for subscription(unsuscribe, multi topic selections/lists, optin functions etc.). The marketing team has to decide this. Either just a .csv with un-subscriptions or as a full blown newsletter service.","0e81b279154bd3d2edf289124771da06a6fe4de7313b718b33d8d5be49619055d90cbd413154071e1fe85ace84f385a1a1a23b31a3a18f0bd494b84f4ce4740e","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","56","b93e87b31021ed700be3eb5f73352ecc5aaf1918f60924d2218c75b7638bbd26c948f6a68df26c0f3ac0aa4cc0a03de15b321ec520f67454328aae0908da240c",1551391902,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/56",NA,NA,11,11,8,NA

> It is build on a open source cms, runs php and mysql

What about site's own source code? I mean any custom settings of the CMS, custom code, scripts, Docker, etc. I mean a public repo like [dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) or [dcrbounty](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty).

> wget --mirror

Ahhh... I did a ton of wget and I absolutely hate it. It is brittle, unreliable, slow and inefficient. After initial download is done, it either gives no incremental sync at all (because most sites suck HTTP-wise) or needs to HEAD every damn URL on the site (can be thousands) to grab a few new pages.

I was hoping for something as robust and fast as `git clone` and `git fetch`. This is why Decred Journal is a [git repo](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news) since day one - you can grab it all in a blink of an eye and sync it later in another blink. Anyone can anonymously get a full local copy of the data and read it offline. If I go to vacation, disappear or go nuts, anybody could quickly host a mirror without searching those couple chosen guys I shared backup keys with. What I'm looking for is git-based content repo like DJ but bigger, with multiple authors. Now I see it (indestructible knowledge repo) is completely different effort and doesn't overlap much with the website, whose primary purpose is to aggregate everything in one place. In fact they could work together.

> Can I mirror? -> No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

So the data is not open :(

To clarify, I'm looking to replicate content only, without logins. Perhaps it can be separated somehow. Having public content mirroring interface (git, rsync or similar) would be awesome to protect content long-term.

> XHTML

Source of truth in XHTML is better than HTML I guess, but worse than Markdown imo.

> video hosting not planned

Got it, so it does not overlap with [file archive](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/26).

> Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?

I guess the answer is yes, admins/operators can just remove it from the database, with only a few admins possible seeing it in the logs.

> metrics

To be clear, I mean first party non-intrusive non-javascript metrics only. No tracking pixels. Plain old HTTP request counting on _your_ own server, aggregated by country, to know how many users visit the site and from what countries. Metrics are important to measure site success, and imo HTTP-based first party metrics are legit.","5082731bb9ed3e10d27c415414136bd028396e520b051d00686f21bba53a4cb9b9660d3016a0f35ed1782082efc2a6972d03c643011dee08af8bd083707ac60d","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","57","25a95ebc2dcbd47d73db0e41830535fb740a1d0876c5e3c5a3fce84ea6b3dea6576fa85580e8ecdfbf82fe065d5a5ea12a29297222bfe701c143fba5799e090b",1551398643,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/57","bee",NA,10,10,8,NA

My biggest concern with that stack is centralized data lock-in. Static sites with full source and data on GitHub like dcrweb or dcrbounty can be fully cloned by dozens or hundreds of decred fans without permission. This is not the case with this website.

Your suggested measure to share backup keys with several trusted community members is not ideal, but is a workable solution.

To be more resilient (and relief my concerns) I suggest to:

* Increase the amount of ""data backup"" people to 4-5.
* Add at least one ""backup webmaster"" person who could reinstate the site from data backup in your absence. He can also serve as one of ""data backup"" people.
* Publicly secure commitment of the above people to make periodic backups and help to restore the site in case of emergency.","7c3fdd5d574157c3dfbaa0413a841ee3e2c390d5f4c4fd832b23708a0323b5bf86a10b9c835fce3ce5fe27e0e81b3c2c3bc06c2bc410aa46e3c87b305e6f3f08","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","59","b15c315c335197492da5863071de5c00132747c06319b9b60e503d6cccc33bcdca4fdd9e87e65606c1b6efac85770d4aadb5af732cf9775548e21ea0a3d0f905",1551517378,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/59","bee",NA,10,9,9,NA

Politeia proposals have different requirements to rule change proposals, and determine the tickets which are eligible to vote through a snapshot of the ticket pool at a specific block height, as opposed to the rolling sortition of on chain voting. It is possible that a Politeia proposal to update the constitution might fail despite a successful on chain vote and the changes being activated.
