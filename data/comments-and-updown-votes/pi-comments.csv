It is a complete and total waste of stakeholder's time as written, because it does not contain any of the technical details necessary to make it work with Decred, budgetary requirements, deployment considerations, a discussion of the myriad negative consequences of such a change to balance the perceived benefits, a discussion of compatibility characteristics, and several othere pieces of information that would be needed to make this a reality if it were to be voted in.  Unfortunately, this amounts to nothing more than a shower thought in its current form and is simply not at all useful as a result.

A proper technical proposal looks something more like [DCP0001](https://github.com/decred/dcps/blob/master/dcp-0001/dcp-0001.mediawiki).

All of that said, and aside from the fact this is not even close to being a proper proposal, the concept of ProgPoW for Decred gets a hard pass from me.","04fd8bb4fc10cfcc496c5068495bffef7bec5e1b38b06fd80ab3ad29b1c0ce009fb42425c04f1ba46b34e08b301b5190b9505cd64a7bd4807da306a43cf97c0d","937e0161deb065604266635e24506e1e79c8cbbd27c7a83483a56ff1b2293f9b","1","319cd54f6c164120a80be2b166605ca2894e1c32b34c94bb20d3d595ff7de853272c3267f69bd50414b6b3e222d0f6b8c4a8e2454b94d70d970b9ae6aa40e50c",1542045474,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/1",16,16,16,0,0

On the content,  I believe this is an horrible idea.... GPUs are more vulnerable to large ""Chinese"" mining farms because there is far less risk to build a GPU farm than using ASICs.  With a GPU farm you can change the coin you mine as often as you want, and even resell the hardware for it's real purpose (gaming). You don't really have skin in the game.

With an ASICs farm,  you can only mine one coin, you cannot resell easily, the risk is higher to get stuck with that hardware. You are quite a bit more invested in the currency you mine.

Maybe the only moment that argument would hold IMO is when a coin is already exclusively mined on GPUs and a new ASIC could be made in secret and take over.  However  in an well established coin like Decred where we have multiple ASICs manufacturers and a strong governance system which can keep miners in check I see this suggestion as an immense step back in security.","42014516845f978fef58ff9e1b3963006fb2e3d8191803cf865087af251c3cbd1171528ebf19a759389f9444b0eaceec1d1811e6621b92dcd5568d685b5f200f","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","2","b63c6ac83c325b6cfcc47ec43d1b9d9a27bfebf9156f193dc76eed4b598cdd552a3ab537819fbdf52869d7cc439397e088636dfd35ccd98a391e138c5cbfb603",1542045691,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/2",10,10,10,0,0

Because of the hybrid PoW/PoS system, it's roughly 20X more expensive to 51% attack, according to recent analysis. This means ASICs pose less risk. In fact, there is a strong argument they increase security, as the increased hashrate they provide, paired with PoS voting, increases the total cost to 51% attack. There could be a possible danger if there was only one or two ASIC manufacturers mining in secret, centralizing nearly all the hashpower. However, the Decred team, perhaps seeing this danger, signaled that they were ASIC friendly from the start, resulting in like half a dozen (or more) ASICs from different manufacturers coming to market, leading to decentralization within the ASIC mining community. 

Also, while I appreciate that this important issue is raised, it seems clear to me from Decred comm channels (slack, telegram, reddit, medium, etc.) that the vast majority of the community is ASIC friendly. I don't think we should waste the stakeholders' time with proposals we know won't pass.","365274b934b53ff2fd9f30679200f2ade36636d6134dc899e9ffad981c001e21583bd212db410405d36ca45dbc0da282a191faa6344cc75fa16c431ca4c3b509","5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","6","6e8fd8f25dd156d61f25db0d6162817eee3caeaac804926daa82458b4819909027e1963ea00655a6f0616b6203d70ed005300a1bff4e5bbb4322626384cd5308",1542454348,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/6",2,2,2,0,0

Another way to drive new community adoption is through PoS ""mining"" (now called PoS voting) via ticket splitting. Right now, tickets cost around $5k, which is out of reach for many potential new community members, just as ASICs are. But with ticket splitting coming online, that comes down to around a couple hundred dollars. This could in effect make Decred the lowest barrier to entry ""masternode"" (though that term is not exactly accurate, it's close enough). Masternodes are a big thing now, especially as the bear market wears on, and people are searching for more steady returns. Once ticket splitting is officially integrated (and it appears it will be), this could be a killer marketing angle to drive new community adoption.","93c90558d90e6a7cd6b8009dfe8eeedaa2c855d2e36a8130c2a39196baf05e0b2dd30d1333d63befbe7ff50e1d6f87ab23e7bc547be8992da1f1a1476fdef400","5122d5762113077bd2968b5b99f826ce54eaa52e72d0c93620351225dabd08be","7","43ee09f565c40e01690aa4205617282efa0afe772d855572e947b9892a634ffdeef303e9be0ec1a8771436072eb27b83eac6f916fc78ae54eb6739a057038704",1542481454,0,0,FALSE,NA,"0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684/comments/7",1,1,1,0,0

We did help rewrite the Politea press release, which resulted from several productive conversations with multiple Decred members over the past few weeks. You can see the final result [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181016005342/en/Decred-Launches-Politeia-Self-Governance-System-Release-20-Million).

Importantly, Ditto was founded on “introductory retainers,” which means proving ourselves and growing. From what we understand, though, there’s a lot of work to be done. We are firm believers in only proposing what a client truly needs (and what we know we can succeed at). And sometimes that means doing one thing really well and growing from there.

Six months is a pretty standard length for a PR campaign — it’s what you’ll encounter with just about any firm you work with. We do offer a 90 day termination clause, meaning if we don’t do what we said we would do in the first 90 days, you have every right to fire us. Honestly, no one has ever utilized that clause.

One more point about our prior experience. We have worked with many serious projects with a long-term roadmap — everyone from Monero to Augur to Chronicled to Origin to Kadena to CoinList – the list goes on. We are a PR firm that has proven itself in the past two years as a team that knows blockchain.

Also, we pride ourselves on being capable of handling as much of the work as possible. Other PR firms definitely aren’t like that. We will request a thorough onboarding and be true partners moving forward, meaning we will be doing most of the work. Our ability to do this is because we deeply understand blockchain and Decred’s value more than your typical PR firm.","f44334ca5e6cc11c6933562eb3f63b7df7a5c7687179296e0ef21c0dd29f7367bb26b6630ab2be6304f6de51cddd92373ea8066637f16a959fc19457565bd006","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","7","09a645f267511d55f1ec94f408a0ead1906f1b6b6e9d294751375b8a21899062d471bda5aef44941d3fc3e9b2b89f57ca7288667169444e0ecdab5324b9e740d",1540249309,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/7",2,2,2,0,0

Honestly, I was quite impressed with your proposal until I got down to the ""When"" part. Paying out in fiat is a huge deal-breaker for me.

I understand there is a risk involved when accepting crypto payment, especially when dealing with a 6-month contract. If DCR suffers a catastrophic event that puts the price into a significant downturn, you're stuck with a contract to fulfill, accepting money that's loosing value every day. As has been mentioned in some of the other comments here, there is also concerns about the 90-day out clause.

May I suggest modifying this proposal to have monthly payouts of DCR, with the option for either party (the Decred stakeholders or Ditto) to terminate the relationship at the close of any given month (perhaps with a requirement of 15 or 30-day notice)? 
- This gives you the leeway to terminate the contract if you're no longer comfortable accepting DCR for payment.
- This also gives the stakeholders an option to opt-out if expected results are not delivered. Stakeholder opt-out would be made in the form of a new Politeia proposal terminating the relationship.","3d6f7585b6085f26dc09e8c198c866d5a72038f4c2ce3d41cf42187c55e714b05ac8fea25c3771d579f6d47882ea6de0a9ac7fcff465304a1757afaf1028f50f","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","b4fba50e7b8d0f0b1d49250eca3ddad3c4e71af6b01aa159c7696ebd92921320b342ed672f584d7ae2958e56177c83998f7a41829abfb2e37d5fcf19abcc0007",1540250595,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/12",5,5,5,0,0

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.

Finally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused.

I do have a similar concern as posted to Wachsmans brief around the _“positioning, messaging, and talking points""_ and having all directional roles rather without any dedicated copywriter/creative/strategist roles. So I will repeat the same train of thought from Wachsmans commentary: 

> “Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation
This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)
Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly.
Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.
When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.
Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.
This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.
Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to.”

From what i’ve seen at dittopr.co, the case studies are very oriented towards the statistical/reach and journalism outputs. I would be rather interested in seeing work that demonstrates more tangible outputs of creative problem solving, thought and strategic ability, and even sheer writing ability, and this being in a brands context rather than only journalism. Ideally this should relate to the expected outputs planned for Decred and have the work talk for itself. 

Considering the Wachsmans competitive proposal is up also, what would you consider your main edge on them? 

Thanks.","4327c6d713b7de22835411e927f21342ad28157be2f6290fbce4623aaac13eb19ff9779ba192a0d2b77a374398f262d62aa7fb161d77367ee5575439f52b0304","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","22","fbe144c37bdd54410c0959bc93468b8d0b74aa3039327ab65f472d017dbfc456427da2afc62a9e743d066c91c6acb975f88cf80b73599e423250f05e1133aa02",1540330293,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/22",2,6,4,2,0

We have a lot to cover from this comment. First, let me say you are asking all the right questions. We are enjoying answering all of them!

“Positioning, messaging and talking points” is probably one of the most important things Ditto does for its blockchain clients. I’d add “media training,” as well.

What you say and how you say it is critical to achieve what we are trying to accomplish. And from Ledger to Origin to Monero to Kadena, we spent a lot of time early on working on this. For some clients, it was more about what they say to different audiences. For other clients, it was about simply coming up with one document on “how to explain ourselves.” We’ve been doing that a lot recently. In a decentralized company, we’d like for everyone to be able to explain who they work for as similarly as possible. That is important not only for journalists, but for internal purposes, as well.

A lot of the founders we work with – many, if not most, are devs – have never done an interview before. So we need to make sure that 1) they know what to say and 2) they are comfortable conducting an interview. That’s why media training is important. We want to make sure that when you talk to anyone from CoinDesk to The New York Times (which you will), you crush it.

I hope that answers one part of your question.

Moving on…

Trey, who founded Ditto, was originally a reporter at the Associated Press. Writing will always be important at Ditto. In fact, we recently hired a VP Kris Kitto, who was also a reporter in Washington D.C. Kris oversees content at Ditto and regularly teaches the rest of us how to be a better writer. Everyone at Ditto is expected to be a good writer. That’s also because we are generalists, meaning we pride ourselves on being good at all the core tenets of PR. Ditto isn’t for everyone. There are PR people out there who JUST want to manage clients or JUST do media relations. A lot of us have some kind of specialty, but we are pretty freakin’ good at all the core communications offerings.

Also, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed. I don’t want to talk too much about Wachsman, who I respect and talk to regularly, but Ditto is outspoken about what makes us different and better, and I think this is an important differentiator to point out. Our team is senior-level PR people. We don’t staff our accounts with one person who’s just good at events, and one senior person who would probably just “manage.” That’s just not how we operate… and it’s working!

A bit of “how the sausage is made:” Every account is required to come up with one smart idea every month. What does that mean? It means strategic advice is mandatory at Ditto. It means that we are thinkers and doers.

I wish we had time to update some of our case studies, but we’ve been busy on client work. That’s another difference between Ditto and our competitors. We are a bunch of super smart PR folks who do a ton of crypto and blockchain work. Every client is important, and every week we bust our ass to give them good counsel and get them the awareness they deserve. Big PR firms have sales people and marketing people who can create case studies on messaging to make them sound good. We just haven’t had the time to do that yet.","e4fc46d30ed2805f070aa14d9f851ee1d04a3c01118a453e09db9f00af97f554d544adfd759151d1e7b4d6f1c8b00187b7b8f7855058f14a4c85cc916251220d","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","23","342362d87853e0a9e128f535d51b701e45c9a89c6361badaa97ae001bcdaec190082885b892526e4e52c9ee78a56919fd776d123c08a882fffdcdc1a2e065008",1540342057,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/23",2,4,3,1,0

Why not, simply lay out a separate contract between you and that party to process the DCR <=> USD exhange according to the terms agreed and remove the USD requirement from this proposal?

Otherwise, the problem I see is that the Decred entity itself has no central authority and cannot for example, open a bank account and process USD payments.

The various stakeholders like myself, who together form this decentralized entity, only have the ability to allow DCR payments from the treasury by voting on proposals. So you may find difficult to have them agree to enter a contract in which they are required to do something impossible (make payments in USD).

Furthermore, as the goal is to eventually have payments made automatically using a smart contract based on votes, this kind of DCR/USD arrangements in a proposal will eventually not be possible anymore unless an intermediary makes the proposal in DCR, and then contract the services is USD.

Finally one danger of leaving the proposal ""as is"", is that it leaves the impression for future proposal, that the treasury can be disbursed to contractors in USD (which is technically false and can only be achieved with a third party).","53a224b2da5ff904946ddde17b96df527d4abd71107139e4629b7601b7caa97348e85b7b60488352478e2f34a0ddfe8e346c61a47e9b0f5b591bb921021d5307","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","24","6d103862d992de73de4b9cabb67c5241dd72661910c363b92ae5596d829a4049b1a8fdcc1c61e2945ab243880d80c0a7744cdaea300d8f702e0369830f7fd101",1540342294,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/24",1,1,1,0,0

I feel some important details are still left out of the proposal. Before I can make up my mind on how to vote I have a few questions and remarks, some more fundamental to Decred in general than others.

First off, how do you envision your impact on Decred after the contract is over? And to be more precise on this point, what are you deliverables? How, as stakeholders, do we test your performance? Where and in what manner will you report? How do we hold you accountable? This is important to know, because how otherwise do we make use of the opt-out clause.

Who is paying the Decred representatives you media train? Who selects these representatives? Will they be paid from this budget? Will event registration fees and other associated costs (like hotel, etc) that you arrange be paid from this budget?

And as a more fundamental question tied to this, who are the people that are representing Decred? We have yet to see a proposal in the spirit of 'I want to represent Decred at events,' or 'this company/group of people wants to take care of event representation and presence.'
Are you proposing to train Company 0 employees or freelancers or your own employees?

Then as others have asked in both this proposal and the other marketing one, (why) do you think Decred needs your entire proposed suite of services for a relatively short 6-month period?","13d62bbfcd360e236e33f157c27f6cb449b160af56b1c0873205e41288bc4b6b6295b3ec2fbc9ece70315322f240fbce1632d5aa6661aaeecb5125166e66140f","00c09bb145ae4ddf1d5ec5a6a80e2697d081e8cf906600c3fca7a9f0e2dca0ab","31","53861a2da20cc0daa8f60c1d9dbd597f6e15d69ba7e89940405b9363c21f90274889cc862f49c2501ddd51232251eea244e5614eb13c524dfa7566c9a4adad09",1540469720,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/31",1,1,1,0,0

It starts by aligning on KPIs and objectives, which will be determined as part of the onboarding process. We’ve already talked about some of the objectives that the community believes are important, but we’ll want to get specific. For instance: How many pieces of coverage per month, how many pieces of content we will produce, how many events per quarter, etc.  That said, we only propose what we think a client needs.

Things we think about:
1) Expert sourcing – When reporters write about governance issues they should be quoting someone from Decred
2) Proactive pitching – Identify monthly issues/topics relevant to Decred that will generate media coverage
3) Quality vs. quantity – We want to balance top tier crypto (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, etc.) with top tier mainstream (NYT, WSJ, Laura Shin, Bloomberg)
4) Decred features – What story lines provide us opportunities to get those bigger stories? We should always be thinking big.
5) News announcements – Do we want to get one really good story through an exclusive, or do we reach out to a handful of reporters?

Once we align in understanding where there is opportunity, we can then layout expected outputs. Ballpark, we tend to get 5-10 pieces of coverage each month for our crypto clients. Where there’s news, it’s even higher.

Onboarding takes no more than 30 days, ideally. This is some of the most important foundation work we will do. This includes messaging, identifying topics/issues Decred should be talking about, looking at any upcoming announcements, news opportunities, etc. We are a results-focused PR firm, so we love outputs and deliverables.

We tend to have a weekly check-in with our clients. Most of that is accountability: What have we done this week, what are we doing next week. Also, there’s some accountability on the client side: We need X and Y from you (without creating too much extra work on your end). Again, this is a partnership.

What we are most eager to get to is the harder results: media coverage, securing speaking engagements, publishing op-eds, etc. One of the things our team couldn’t stand while working at bigger, global PR firms was 30, 60, 90 days into a new client, the firm was still “strategizing” and “creating memos,” but the client was like “Yeah, but where are the results??” There’s a lot of important foundational work to be done, but Ditto is always eager to “go external.”

I would check with Dustin from Decred on additional fees. Things like travel and conference fees are not traditionally included in PR plans. Also, on who is representing Decred. That would be part of what we’d hope to discover during the onboarding process. The same is true for media training. Once we identify who or whom will be representing Decred from an external standpoint, we will train them on certain aspects of how to engage with the media that will hopefully ensure leads to coverage with the right message being conveyed. All media training is included in the price of the monthly agreement.","9a1bb3540602f91bc0668c686abf1a0ef53095b869f8b2f64d417551132bedcaaab2500ec74143fe3ad85dfbd0cde3b8407cced4f7aa9d55964171d89e1a0704","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","32","bd39c1c6de7bbebb08615a34e9a09c5adca7f397b3ec85c92684863869ce0d1585de8805a308ee46b4c34a330c5f935edefaf7f30b7d8489cf24889e0a868c01",1540487434,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/32",1,1,1,0,0

**First, what are the main differences between Wachsman and Ditto?**

This is a really good and important question. As we alluded to in our proposal on Politeia, Ditto is very much an “anti-PR firm” in that we fundamentally believe the traditional business model of PR firms is broken.

Firstly, everyone at Ditto has a technical level of expertise and understands the nuances of blockchain/crypto in a way that far surpasses our competitors.

Secondly, we understand your culture and your community, and we share your values. We’ve worked with decentralized communities like Monero that place a premium on privacy and unanimity. We’ve listened to the feedback the community has given, and we’ve made the necessary adjustments. We understand and appreciate the unique characteristics that make the Decred community what it is, which will translate into the right kind of advice and partnership when it comes time to do the work, versus more traditional marketing tactics or buzzwords.

The third and most important differentiator is results. We believe in radical honestly and transparency and will only tell you what we believe to be possible. What you see is what you get, and we’re happy to provide a synopsis of the results we’ve gotten over the years. Our vast network of reporters and the relationships we have in the media value this, as well. So when we pitch a story or reach out to a journalist, they know and appreciate the companies that work with Ditto are of the highest legitimacy and credibility.

Finally, Ditto is top heavy, meaning most of us are senior-level PR people. Every account has a team that can think strategically, give good advice, and execute a plan. The biggest complaint we get from incoming clients looking for a new PR firm is the “bait and switch.” Sold by senior PR execs, only to get handed off to junior people. We are about 80+% super smart senior PR people. You just don’t get that at other PR firms, where pitching is relegated to junior people and some senior people only do strategy. Not at Ditto. You can see that from the team we proposed (more on that in a bit).

**Next question: Can you justify the 5k extra that Ditto is asking for compared to Wachsman?**

As outlined in our conversations with the Decred community prior to this process, the fee matches the proposed scope of work. Content, media relations, conferences/events, thought leadership, and the amount of time and resources we would devote to this led us to $25K in DCR. If it is determined that the community only wants content and media relations, as opposed to conferences and events, we can adjust the proposal and the price accordingly. I also want to point out that both our CEO Trey Ditto and myself — the two most senior people at Ditto — will staff the account and give you personalized attention.

**Next question: I see you have a Monero as one of your clients. Someone asked Ricardo his involvement with ditto and he mentioned that he worked with your company on a personal level not with Monero. Could you please elaborate.**

We worked with Monero around their Project Coral Reef announcement, and we were subsequently hired by Tari, a project by Ric and Naveen. That, to us, indicates that they were pleased with the level of service we provided and hired us for a launch announcement that was widely covered. It’s worth noting, like with a lot of clients, we do know Ric on a personal level, as well. We are partners with our clients. By the way, here’s [an article]( http://fortune.com/2018/05/23/crypto-blockchain-monero-ticketfly-project-tari/) we generated in Fortune for the Tari announcement and here’s [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/05/cryptocurrency-monero-to-be-accepted-by-musicians-such-as-mariah-carey-g-eazy-sia-for-holidays/#1955c93060eb) we generated in Forbes for Monero. There we of course multiple other outlets that covered this news.  

**And finally: Would you be able to provide a list of Ditto team members who we can expect to interact with on a daily basis?**

The Ditto team members who would interact with you on a regular basis are the ones listed in our proposal: our CEO Trey Ditto, Managing Director Blain Rethmeier, Vice President Margaret Huang, Account Executive Milvian Prieto, and Associate Vice President Liz Bagot.","1e00a6419d34f50b3471688092ebc0c3b95482f18387ec51a14000be7579e21c9b8c3563d38041f859475bfa95f931ef9ff7e151d335dabfffa2dc347f7f6a02","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","33","b3f9a71a0b810e70ddbb3d4731bf9a6fef8382667394db6224286b116e2e7e785a1f37508748f0ea094eacd4123bc14c548dd21e3fa67d2e85f1d7efdb4cd50a",1540494071,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/33",2,2,2,0,0

But if we are being honest, one of the reasons Ditto and Wachsman are the top two crypto PR firms out there is because of our results. Top tier results are what we have in common! That’s good news for Decred.

So, [here’s a smattering of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPcDM7hjwgNDxlkQOmZ3ChW2EQzbtBl6wpHZZk4_1Mo/edit?usp=sharing) we’ve secured for some of crypto clients over the past year. 

We chose the past year as the timeframe because we want to show that we didn’t just have a lucky couple of weeks — this is month over month consistency and delivering on what we promised. And we chose a handful of clients and just a sampling of coverage because that should show you that media coverage is one of the things we are good at.

But even in the past week, clients have had features in everything from _CoinDesk_ to _SF Business Times_ to _Bloomberg TV_ to _Breaker Magazine_ to _The Block_. We could be here all day just going through “media hits”!

When I look at our list and Wachsman’s list, there are a few differences: Ditto has a much more robust mix of national TV, top tier crypto, and top tier mainstream. Don’t get me wrong — there are some Tier 2/3, but our coverage seems a little more elevated.

Also, the final thing I’d add, just looking at Wachsman’s coverage, is that they have a lot of stories written by contributors, whereas we tend to work directly with staff reporters. One, working directly with reporters means more people will read the story. Two — and we aren’t saying this is the case — but a lot of contributors are pay-to-play. That’s just not our style.

In the interest of moving beyond just getting clients hits, there’s a backstory to every time a client is in the news. What went into that?

1)    **Being proactive** – Ditto saw a trend in the industry and positioned the client

2)    **Important issues** – Clients have issues/topics (community, scaling, speed, security, etc.), and we keep them in the news on those issues

3)    **Messaging** – We put in the time to make sure we are relaying to the media the clients’ stories in a way that ensures positive coverage

4)    **Talking Points** – Before any interview, we think about, “What do we want to say in this specific interview to get our point across?”

5)    **Media training** – Could be as simple as a quick mock interview the day before, but we make sure the client is as ready as possible

So, while we can just look at volume and quality, at Ditto, there’s a lot more care that goes into what ends up being printed.","0421a68e06a351ba0c62a1d7d7f56480859b99f1da69577769664e0ce2e71eb76186368917c218f5ecfc531d1c023e636e97fac0ae3a4fd8363797d53501ed0a","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","34","63c686853241c4a50ce57307743fac459d1ca7eb3e806cace415d4472afec00972c02321731d2fd3c190c8188f1d0dca0c0362a72e12ee5c596d67251bcf030b",1540503319,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/34",1,3,2,1,0

The plan we laid out focuses on community growth and engagement by raising your visibility, elevating your brand and better defining your value proposition to externally facing audiences.

Metrics aside, there is something to be said about overall “awareness.” Many of our clients who have never done PR before say “We just want the community to know about us more.” And a lot of that work is targeting devs and the crypto community. It’s hard to measure awareness, although we utilize a few platforms to gauge traction of stories. And we are constantly monitoring what is and isn’t working and making adjustments.

Regarding timing, we can’t think of a better time than now. Politeia is live, and we’re at the very beginning of a revolution. PR now will help drive awareness, facilitate development, and increase awareness of future Decred updates.

How do you guys at Ditto measure success internally?

Can you provide some guidance on how Decred could come up with  success measures we can establish up front to set concrete expectations, and set targets you can measure yourselves against so that success is not solely subjective and ambiguous? 

Any examples of top client interactions that were the most successful and why would be helpful.","bbd44563e47a3813a6515bdc231d0d5c6b665e1e4c7e6f5926beaa72dd8c7f255922eb5f70629d66214dbad7a6f7e2f4a7510f6edbcacd74ec6f9b03b9aac606","6b19278a1e5a3a21e44da5377c6ded5a91862126d18c8e08a2370affe715537d","37","6cbbeb9d9bd66afac2de2183318418b5bc6bfe73a6d36a7e48da64d1b8c7bfbefbae7c5d90e555968bfa507527e7d8823c7b06cc5d09fe219705f8e000590d0d",1540656111,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/37",2,2,2,0,0

Every month client teams come together and set their metrics that align with each client. Every account is different, but it basically includes: quantity and quality of media coverage, content written and published and one what we call an “extended communication” (social media, speaking, award submission, partnership, etc.). 

As we have said in other comments, we believe in going much farther than outputs, which we are really good at. We also measure quality of service. Every account has to come together and send the client one “smart idea” each month. This pushes us to be creative, proactive and always trying something new. 

The best feedback we got once was from Avi Flombaum, co-founder of Flatiron School: Every month Ditto sent us a new idea, pushing us to stay ahead. We didn’t act on many of them, which was more an internal thing on our end, but it showed us that Ditto understood our business and was always thinking about us. 

Finally, we have a “client facing” section, meaning we should be talking to the client on a personal and professional level every month. Again, we are your partner! Our internal metrics – which Trey has to approve – are historically higher than what the client expects. Here’s the fun part: Every team that does all these things: hits their outputs, sends a creative idea and interacts with the client gets a bonus at the end of the month.

It’s why Ditto is a better PR firm. We believe in doing high quality, high output work and then rewarding staffers for doing killer work.

Examples of interactions. First, I’m happy to put you in touch with Avi from Flatiron School. They were a client for 4 years – until WeWork bought them. It’s the perfect example of Ditto:
1) Lifelong partners – As I said above, it was a deep partnership where we cared about them and vice versa. Trey and Avi became best friends in fact.
2) Month over month results – for 4 years, they averaged 100+ stories every year.
3) High quality – They were front page WSJ, Business Section B1 of NYT, on national TV 4+ times a year.
4) Results attached to business – When we got them coverage, website traffic spiked and sign-ups happened.
5) Positioning – Flatiron School went from maybe #4 coding bootcamp in the country to #1 based on our work and their high quality service.

We have crypto examples too:
- [CoinList](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/coinlist/)
- [Monero](https://www.dittopr.co/portfolio-item/monero/)

We need to do some more crypto case studies. Just been too busy doing PR work than marketing ourselves. Hopefully you understand we balance strategy, quality, quantity and client relations better than anyone else.

We would set Decred targets in our onboarding meeting. Something super easy to set now is Decred will be interviewed and get media coverage in the top crypto and mainstream publications. From _CoinDesk_ to _New York Times_ to Laura Shin's podcast, we can promise that Decred will gain recognition in all top tier outlets. We are confident about this because all of our clients (as you saw in our media coverage examples) get this attention. 

For events, we’d like to see Decred have an elevated presence. This means speaking at the high-quality crypto conferences. This does NOT mean having booth babes and going to conferences that are a waste of time.","4d36bf83c7bb5e9a107f6a1420120a157dc2f3045dc3e4d4bb49942fe3d5ca366ffd48ea039bb26042a25481326543d29f2c0a6c3b2740f961b098e945540405","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","38","520cfcb25e268dba89dfe0d62777b4f4f64acf75fa0f1ca45bd8985498cef65d183d9cad8a480f1b07b96a77ac425ae563ffa04dff8b511db016f76f4abcf10e",1540680285,0,0,FALSE,NA,"27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50/comments/38",2,2,2,0,0

I really like this one. For the past 2 years, the ""major media"" was acting weird in relation to Decred. They kept rehashing governance issues and seemed to recognize the problem, but never reached for comment to a project that has delivered so much with most pragmatic and sane approach.

My counter of materials who ""omitted"" Decred is currently at 74 and I made a few theories, but the main point is, if this ever changes it will be a big win for the project.

1.    Trey answered this on Reddit and our counsel is that we don’t believe you need two PR firms. But we have worked with other PR firms with other clients in the past (typically the other firm has a very specific focus separate from ours), and it worked out.

2.    We think creating materials that have maximum utility is important and sharing is going to be important to this campaign — and there will definitely be times where we should get the Decred community’s insight.

3.    We do quite a bit of work in Asia — we have a couple of Chinese clients, just finished helping launch Ledger’s Hong Kong office, and have helped facilitate interviews in Chinese. Additionally, we have relationships with the Russian media. I think once we get a good work flow going and we earn your trust and prove ourselves, we should as quickly as possible add that on. A lot of the U.S. media is translated and read by China, Japan, Korea, Russia, etc.

4.    You’re right — there is so much noise at conferences and events. A lot of our clients don’t even have the budget – or desire – to pay to play. We should definitely think about how to “hijack” a conference and develop an ""anti-event"" strategy.  

5.    Trey also just touched on this on Reddit. I think much of the work we will do will better define Decred and elevate awareness of Decred within the Dev community. But at some point, we have to think of more direct ways to get in front of devs. That will definitely be part of our campaign, and we’d want to listen and talk to you all to figure out the best way to do it.

6.    Dustin is probably the best person to answer that question.

DCR is already available for on Easyrabbit it seems, and the relatively small price for the ""upgrade"" comes with some real benefits to Decred, which do come at a cost to this exchange.

Specifically, (1) widget integration and (2) lower fees for users, come at a cost to the exchange and have obvious benefits to users of DCR.  Arguably, this is true for social media promotion where there's only so much room for tweets about the coins they support.

On the other hand, paying to put the DCR logo in their ""featured section"" is arguably of less value and feels a bit against our values.  Is that different from social media promotion?  Maybe not much, but the reach of social media is important for informing/reminding those already interested in DCR that there is another service they can use.  But featured placement on their homepage does not seem necessary if you come to the site already knowing what you want to do (hopefully buy DCR).

What can go wrong with this proposal? ""Constant promotion"" sounds a bit like spam everyone all the time.  Also, the mere acceptance of this proposal could reflect poorly, if it weren't for the redeeming fact that 30 DCR is a modest sum that is actually appropriate for the added services.

Another consideration is what volume does this site have and how much benefit do these lowered fees offer DCR user, in aggregate?","1d356d26cdd18b5a6e2a85b8fd50ccbfbf52795672e2c79d417ea437e1afa14b1e54072c11b722efe4a7f8015b852e946c7aa420431c01035ffc3531d2042e00","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","3","08da21270be1f34f2cfc8a091abd16369d6afbdb58f0d9312f1a8703fccc2cbee15ba8737dbf29d5b3fd7cc7e43760706b2b6a54924e4dee64d547d8b9c6b80c",1541017899,0,0,FALSE,NA,"34707d34b09c3ebcf0d4aa604e8a08244e8f0f082c0af3f33d85778c93c81434/comments/3",2,2,2,0,0

What could you possibly do with those 30DCR that you couldn't do for free?

In other words, if you can do it for as low as 30 DCR, why can't you just do it for 0 DCR?

It seems it wouldn't go to ingo paying labor, hence my skepticism.

Makes me wonder if the motivation for this proposal is not using this platform for self-promotion? Kind of like how some go to Shark Tank / Dragon's Den to ask for money but they don't really need the money, they just want to show their product on TV.

My first thoughts on such listing fee propositions have to do with understanding if the exchange actually has justification for the fee.

A regular exchange asking a listing fee just to list an asset, when fees from that assets trading bring profit to the exchange, is a huge red flag for me.  They should list the coin anyway since the alternative is to get no profit at all (this is what most respectable exchanges seem to do).

What I see here is an exchange that has already listed the asset and is offering a lowered fee among other things.  Now, it is a valid question to ask if the initial fees were already too high, or if the lowered fees are lowered enough.","39283014355dc59fededa67229b1a6445c453641c1cd2b8314cc02b6232a54831612caafe721464f3aa63c09c2789e36332e885e7990f0af22f7c4e539d40505","22b54aa3030d05ebb4ab31c5c719b8fec9d979928ce517222fe80195e0d3596d","10","4eb3403593af1ecfa18dffed082aeb1ce72a2eea7e1da637dbdb7c1d6761718e6305bcece39a4c2e38ea00bb3bd20659a1c7b0ac41094e9055b57cb344996b00",1541036762,0,0,FALSE,NA,"34707d34b09c3ebcf0d4aa604e8a08244e8f0f082c0af3f33d85778c93c81434/comments/10",1,1,1,0,0

The dev team also regularly puts proposals up for voting, and you can join one of the chat endpoints (#politeia in slack) if you want to specifically ask one to be put up for voting.

Currently supported coins did not provide any founding for few reasons:

1) This was a first batch of currencies. Now wallet is usable so you can check it out before making any decision.
2) All coins other than BTC and ETH were a low hanging fruit that were added because tools and providers I use support those, now each extra coin would require an extra effort.
3) Those coins did not have a voting/proposal/treasury system. I really love the idea of a community driven project and I was actually advised to post my project here to see what happens.

Your concern does make a point though and that's why I tried to keep it reasonable.

I would also note that if my wallet wouldn't be open sourced I wouldn't bother Decred community with this proposal.

> The primary rationale for moving away from the term stake pool is that it is often erroneously, and understandably, conflated with PoW mining pools in terms of the way mining pools engage in reward sharing where the pool has custody of the user's funds until they disburse them.

> In stark contrast, stake pools, or Voting Service Providers, under the proposed vernacular, never take custody of the user's funds and do not offer reward sharing.

> Another term that was discussed on this front and considered was voting server, however, I personally don't think that would be a good term as voting sever implies there is only a single server, which is not the case.

I've defaulted for awhile now to saying - ""You stake your DCR in order to be selected in the future to vote on blocks mined via PoW."" So the change to PoS Voting certainly fits the narrative.

As for VSPs - would want to continue to explore terms. Is there any concern that it's close to ISP? That's what popped into my head when I first read the proposal. Obviously a lot of negative connotation to the term ISP and many elements that are at odds with public blockchains. Would worry about new members of the community having to learn the term.

Having experienced first hand the quality of work that the Decred team (and community) oversees, I have no doubt that this has potentially to become a widely used exchanged.

In summary, I would be in favor, but it will somewhat depend on the following:



1. **The Benefits to Decred**
In many ways, I feel an exchanged such as this would be a much needed ""Gift"" to the community, whilst the bill will be picked up by existing Decred stake-holders, as well as the time & effort put in by the Core team. As a result, I think it would be good to understand a more comprehensive value proposition that this may hold for Decred itself?  I agree that the marketing side of things would be a great start, especially if this becomes a popular exchange, but would be keen to understand potential other benefits to Decred as a project, and as a community.


2. **Confidence in obtaining credible and capable contractors**
How confident are you that there are available contractors that will be able to do this work, within budget, whilst adhering to the high quality that the Decred community is used to?


3. **Projected Cost**
The projected cost of this project currently specifies quite a wide range. What would the difference be (from a delivery, quality, features, and time-line perspective) between the lower end and the upper end?

I do have a few concerns about a Stakeholder funded DEX in general:
 
### -**Relative Cost**
$100,000 to $1,000,000 at current rates is ballpark 6,000 to 60,000 DCR. At the high end, this is approximately 10% of the current DAO treasury holdings, or about 3% of the entire treasury subsidy that will ever exist. [treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx)

### -**DEX Landscape is crowded**
The DEX landscape is crowded. There is the Binance DEX, Blocknet, OpenLedger, IDEX, CryptoBridge, Bisq, Bancor DEX, Kyber, 0x, etc... I know a lot of these are semi-centralized, take a fat commission, require shit-tokens, are still WIP, etc... so don't get on my ass about it. My point is that the landscape is already crowded and is getting more crowded. 

### -**Concerns about lot size order matching**
This one is a bit complicated so bear with me. Essentially to avoid all the shady games that go on with centralized exchanges, the idea is to use lot sizes when matching orders. IE, say I put up 30 DCR for 0.006 BTC each, but someone only wants 20 DCR for 0.006 each, my 30 DCR would need to be subdivided into smaller lots to make the trade happen.

The issue here is twofold: price discovery is limited by the granularity of lot size, and on-chain fees could eat up smaller trades.

**Price Discovery & Granularity**
The resolution of price discovery is limited by both the order size and the minimum lot size. Smaller lot sizes and larger order sizes both increase the resolution of price discovery. IE, for price resolution of +/- 1% of a given exchange rate, you'd need at least one of the assets to have lot sizes of 1/100th of the order being placed (_well, either that, or accept that trades would occur at specific ""harmonics"" where the relative lot sizes of each asset matched the desired exchange rate_). This means that price discovery would degrade at lower value transactions, and leads to my 2nd point:

**On-Chain Fees**
If we do need end up needing transactions to be made up of many small lots to allow price discovery to occur, consider that all transactions will be on-chain. Especially for smaller transactions, this could eat up a significant % of the total transaction value, possibly enough to make the fees or commission on other exchanges seem more attractive in comparison. Especially if we return to conditions where Bitcoin (and possibly Decred) fees are considered expensive.

_TLDR_; I think it's a noble idea but I'm concerned it will be an expensive, low-volume, niche market for high-value transactions.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Curious to see what others think.","5e011eea3df9e82c4b40e8a0dc76ac6a04ebe0172d038b5794e532402f0981019a5e3de7a10b7b6771ef16f5d5f70ca4c797246343eab35668808b5e4aa3e706","561e590b88343c5ccb54b700ac686484cc392e656c66d1823842d2cbb37c0327","3","67bd0767f8816f61dfe6fd83e55f7560925d9d0b13772fac94af1d88e7d6d18a3b4b50f1b212c4ffcb72e50af47c11ed2579040202ddde73e5409ce54bb0470f",1549330338,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/3",10,12,11,1,0

---

First off, to put things into perspective, the high-end ask for this proposal is $1M USD.

- At the current DCR/USD exchange rate of $15.75, that is 63,492 DCR. 
- Given the current treasury balance of 605,900 DCR, this expenditure would deplete 10.47% of the treasury.
- Assuming the current treasury block reward of 1.87804688, it would take 33,807 blocks, or 117 days - around 4 months (assuming 5mins/block), to ""pay off"" this amount. This does not take into account the fact that the block reward decreases over time, or the occasional block that doesn't include all 5 ticket votes (cutting that block reward), so the actual time period would be longer.

All these statistics assume that the market price stays the same (which it won't, though I won't speculate which direction it's heading). Given these figures, it's clear that this is a significant outlay of funds, and therefore deserves careful thought and scrutiny.

---

IMHO, the treasury funds should only be spent for two purposes:

- Funding the ongoing maintenance of Decred software, etc. to ensure that DCR does not loose its market value.
- Funding projects that will increase the market value of DCR, rewarding the stakeholders.

Clearly, this proposal does not fit in the former purpose; we shall discuss whether it fits within the latter.

I believe my view on the purpose of the treasury is consistent with sentiments that have been expressed on other proposals, especially [this highly-upvoted comment on the recent Baeond proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14). Quoting an excerpt from there:

> The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).
> 
> The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

An exchange/DEX (however cool it may be), is not directly related to Decred (other than supporting it as an asset). I fail to see how this project will benefit Decred (or have a benefit of sufficient magnitude to justify the cost).

---

The proposal states:

> This improved exchange infrastructure will benefit Decred directly, by making the exchange process more permissionless, thereby increasing its accessibility.

How will this make buying Decred more accessible? Today, I can go to https://changenow.io/ and swap BTC for DCR without creating an account, without KYC/AML (in most cases), and have my DCR within 20 minutes. This is just one example, I am sure there are other instant swap providers with similar offerings.

This exchange promises only to support crypto-to-crypto swaps. Potential DCR buyers already have a far bigger hurdle to overcome, and that is turning fiat into BTC. For many people, that is accomplished via signing up to a centralized exchange, often doing KYC. For some, that exchange is an exchange like https://bittrex.com/ that supports DCR, allowing them to convert USD to DCR (albeit via two trades).

I am aware of the fact that the proposed DEX uses atomic swaps, but I fail to see how removing the requirement of trusting an instant exchange will make Decred so much more accessible that it will increase the price of DCR in a meaningful way (much less compensate the cost of the project).

The proposal further states:

> However, it will also benefit the overall cryptocurrency ecosystem as a piece of common infrastructure, which we can use as a marketing tool.

While I agree that such a DEX will be a marketing tool, again, I question whether its effectiveness there will be enough to defray the cost building it.

The treasury is not a VC firm or grant fund. Just because the DEX is open-source doesn't mean we should just throw grant money at it. The idea itself may be sound, but the Decred treasury isn't the place to fund such an idea IMO.","52c1f11785480904c19d66d9c28b7cfde25498aa5796bfe976dda2b924932e3da5c23c5a2f954a750c5dd27cb621165b65516cc151751865ce692d1a59fdad00","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","4","c11e76ae8b122ce968031b2d61c7b6b75659c74c41f1d55285cdc3a7fad96613f28a363dbea8579f4c78df3757fab6a4c9e213c9184d498e17894a0ef1710f08",1549380623,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/4",6,8,7,1,0

By definition, DEX means swaps with other coins. Why wouldn't they share the expenses? At least Sia could [be interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/7tfi0i/improving_the_exchange_situation/). Another possibly interested parties are exchanges.

Verifiable volume and activity is a huge long-term benefit for the credibility of the whole space. Decent actors should be very interested in this.

I suggest to do word spreading and negotiations work first, at least try. It could be a fund where Decred's Treasury is one of many participants with smaller amounts. If successful it can be huge. Expenses and Treasury.

Our expenses are up significantly, current burn rate is already $400K/month - please correct if wrong.

> Any protections against fast bots like per-account rate limiting?

I had mentioned in my blog post on the topic, which I will link to in an update to the proposal, that very simple rules could be created to rate-limit trades, e.g. UTXOs used for orders must have not moved for N hours or more to be considered valid.  This would greatly limit the rate at which orders can be placed by fast bots and mitigate the vast majority of known ""dark"" trading patterns.  

> Any plans to actively engage other chains to integrate?

This process has already begun in our [atomicswap repo on GitHub](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap/), where other projects have added support for doing atomic swaps on their corresponding chains.

> Any plans for protocols that don't leave a trace of swap on the chains?

The first step is always making it work.  Once it is working, obfuscating the swaps on the corresponding chains can happen.  IIRC, there was discussion about using some homomorphic encryption tricks to do just this on BCT.

> Does the TLS mention mean the system involves Certificate Authorities?

I believe the CA system is less than worthless - it is incredibly harmful to communications security.  We use TLS with dcrd, dcrwallet and dcrctl with self-signed certificates for exactly this reason.  The whole CA system exists so that web users can try to avoid knowing anything about security via a list of approved CAs bundled with each browser.","24f50064b87bab373f7fdcf1f0b66bcd40e14672b261b8a9dce01e367453389691b88dfd3238da6d9c2c2bc2d7b58aa35b60ae167d9313e30ffb39f93626cc0a","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","12","ac53cf31fa15553cb9ee3022dabd3ec506956d3b1fc5b94c283a8b9420277766638e0388252a3a03915640f5d7b0d6402c2a989615b868a5333159330c463803",1549472468,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/12",6,6,6,0,0

First, I consider ryanzim to provide generally good constructive criticism, which I will address below.  Second, ryanzim is a developer for the Exodus wallet, which, as far as I am aware, collects fees on exchanges performed in their wallet and is their project's primary source of income.  This presents, IMO, a pretty clear conflict-of-interest regarding the view he has shared on the proposal.

I agree that the upper end cost cited for the work is high at USD 1M, and it was not intended to indicate that would be _likely_ cost of the work, merely that we should not entertain proposals to build it for any amount greater than that.

Regarding the relevance of the proposal, I would argue that it is very much relevant to Decred.  Several notable DCR holders have brought up that they consider our lack of liquidity to be a problem that needs fixing.  The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  One of the reasons that MMs cost so much is that they are typically experienced proprietary traders who have to deal with the risks and stresses of a wide variety of bots being run against them.  If the MM gets cleaned out by someone else's bots, they have no reason to continue making the market and will quit.  If we build a system that uses pseudorandom order matching, this substantially reduces the threat of being gamed by others' bots, which lowers the risks and stresses associated with being a MM.  Lowering the barriers to being a MM will lead to a deeper order book and help decentralize our liquidity, versus paying one or a few MMs to perform this task for us.

Comparing a custodial ""instant"" exchange to a DEX that uses atomic swaps is comparing apples and oranges.  ChangeNOW is certainly an interesting service, but it is permissioned - per their FAQ ""ChangeNOW’s AML/KYC procedure is supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is marked suspicious by this system, the exchange is put on hold and the customer in question is then asked to confirm their identity.""  Note that instant exchanges do nothing to solve the problem of order book depth that we have, which creates slippage for people entering and exiting DCR positions.

I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like.  If we take a moment to look at the big picture with cryptocurrencies, it goes something like this:

* The irresponsible behavior of banks cued SN to create/release Bitcoin, which decentralized value storage and transmission via gamification of the timestamping process.
* The central planning committee of Bitcoin Core / Blockstream cued me to work with tacotime and _ingsoc to create and release Decred, which decentralized sovereignty via gamification of the decision-making process.

My motivation to create Decred was based on experiencing the bullshit of Bitcoin's central planning committee firsthand, and I had the luxury of tacotime having proposed a system that could address precisely this problem concurrent with my experiences.  After 3 years of building out Decred, it has become clear to me that a major hurdle for the project is that of market liquidity.  This proposal is a reflection of my seeing this centralization and gatekeeping of liquidity as being the next major problem for a cryptocurrency-based ecosystem to resolve, i.e.

* The centralization of liquidity within the CC ecosystem cued me to propose decentralized exchange via ""ungamification"" of the trading process.","4fd94edecbf973ea3f2779d8d770075894c8c18b88bc6fbb73c0a5db3d33f65fdecfbca0a7595afc39dae47bad6026c46c57ab5eaedbe36699b5867bed15c405","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","15","fdea538af785ae79c8afd33ed0d957013e892d8d1d9c0eae782267e474546aaf34c02a8acf3dee9f0d79a8af718ccfc6fce809be095959a43dd475848d28620e",1549477522,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/15",7,11,9,2,0

The DEX landscape is indeed crowded.  I am of the view that most of these projects have the wrong incentive structure, i.e. collecting fees on trades, which is a pretty fundamental difference between what is being proposed here and what already exists.  When you're collecting fees on trades, you're incentivized to generate volume, not order book depth, which is what I believe we all really want.

Your issues with lot sizes are valid, but the reality of working with on-chain transactions as the basis for unfalsifiable orders acts as a strong constraint on what we can do.  The partial fill problem is tricky.  I would expect there to be several lot sizes being traded concurrently in a healthy DEX-based market, which would mean there would be several pairs traded, each at a pair of chosen lot sizes.  In more detail, we could have DCR/BTC markets that have (DCR 10, BTC 0.01), (DCR 1, BTC 0.001), and (DCR 0.1, BTC 0.0001) lot sizes, where episodic arbitrage occurs between them.

Once fee pressure becomes an issue with the lot sizes, I would expect some of the exchange to move off-chain and occur over LN, per my blog entry comments.","ab612b1ebaf427e743368faa386a6515f9c290ce100d068e384da9a0ddc5729687622f2cf277ced0f1791bc14b3364cadb83b8003f6523f69aa6bb74477c8b0e","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","16","6b409fc70af042857ae7f5da1813286ae5066bfd47f4ea3799bf5816daad9f32f564c00a95e683b7e34c87316d8313fa05965911cb90cbf37d4a970bae693b0b",1549478594,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/16",3,3,3,0,0

I am aware of the potential conflict-of-interest here. Personally, I have serious reservations about the architecture of the exchange itself (fee structure, etc.), but I have refrained from discussing them here since there is almost no way I can discuss them without potential conflict-of-interest. Instead, I have solely focused on the issue of whether the Decred treasury should pay for the DEX, since I feel there is less potential for conflict-of-interest there.

Also, for the record, all my opinions here are my own personal opinions, not those of my employer, and I am receiving no compensation for expressing my opinions here. Hopefully that goes without saying, but I thought I'd make it explicitly clear.

Understood, thanks for clarifying. Regardless, I believe my point still stands that this is a significant outlay of funds, and needs careful consideration.

Regarding your two paragraphs about liquidity/MMs/instant exchanges:

It seems I somewhat misunderstood your main intention behind the exchange; I was arguing under the assumption that by ""increasing accessibility"", you meant ""making it easier for new people (either noobs to crypto, or people already in crypto, but new to DCR) to buy their first DCR"". Reading your reply here, it seems I've misunderstood.

If I'm understanding you correctly, your primary motivation for building the exchange is:

1. There isn't enough Decred liquidity
1. You don't want to pay a MM to increase liquidity
1. Instead, you want to build a DEX that will want to make people be MMs for DCR without direct pay
1. You believe this will also have a side effect of decentralizing market-making
1.  ChangeNOW does nothing to solve your primary gripe with the current situation: liquidity

Please correct me if I've misunderstood you yet again.

> I am disappointed to see you characterize this proposal as VC-like

VC-like probably isn't the right term to use. I don't mean that your exchange proposal is some ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme; I don't mean that the proposal fundamentally misunderstands what crypto is all about, like too many VC firms do; etc.

Let me try to clarify my position on what I feel should and should not receive treasury funding. Examples are probably best to illustrate my point.

Things the treasury is for funding:

- Maintaining Decred software
- Building a mobile wallet for Decred
- Building Politeia
- Building a DAE to manage the treasury funds
- Building libraries to make it easier for other products to implement Decred
- Funding marketing for Decred

Things the treasury could possibly fund (debatable):

- Integration into an existing ATM network
- Integration fees for a hardware wallet

Things out of scope for treasury funding (in my OP, I incorrectly used the term VC-like to refer to these kinds of things):

- Building an all-new hardware wallet
- Building a new crypto ATM machine that supports Decred
- Building an exchange (centralized or decentralized)

In short, this exchange may or may not become popular. If it becomes popular, it may or may not help Decred liquidity (i.e. maybe it'll just be the most popular way to exchange BTC/LTC). We have no way of knowing for sure.

I fail to see how building a better exchange is any more deserving of funding from the treasury, than building a better hardware wallet or ATM machine. Does the world need better hardware wallets, ATM machines, or exchanges? Maybe, maybe not; but I don't believe the treasury needs to fund any of these projects.","af38dc951b3e0c187d4086b2e2cce91a48465cd6fd4871d31bc5bd182cf5092590c6524fa5872c8dd2a87d0737e717c61baaa350831498c1371954956d6d5904","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","18","9238d82c525e918921fec0752d0b33707e77e630d20c79c2de5aed2682cf76698d39874fee69a6a5d5849a97d589242dae925168cbbed6ac8f24c4fdf501c905",1549481752,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/18",2,4,3,1,0

It would be inappropriate to spend this amount of treasury funds on a low project priority DEX.  What if the price of Decred continues to drop?  Despite what some people believe, the treasury will run dry someday.  The amount of Decred being proposed for the dex will fund a decade or more of critical development needs years from now.

In my opinion the actual resources expended will be closer to the upper limit of the cost and time estimates.  I’m basing this on the historical performance of milestone forecasting on this project.

As discussed on Slack, I think there are a lot of good ideas in the implementation details and a lot of the issues raised are well founded and researched. My objection is on a few fronts simultaneously, although none of them relate to the technical implementation details - not because I don't have reservations, but because the other objections supersede them anyway. So, in no particular order:

1. There is little guarantee that the exchange will gain traction and aid Decred in any meaningful way.  
   1. Numerous similar projects with great teams have tried and failed to gain liquidity (even centralised exchanges with large budgets).  
   2. I'm unsure if a DEX is what the vast majority of people that will bring liquidity want; most people I know, whilst they grumble at KYC, are quite happy with Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, etc.  
   3. It is possible that even if the DEX attracted liquidity for some crosses (such as ETH/BTC, or BCH/BTC), it still might not attract liquidity for DCR.
2. This would benefit all cryptocurrencies listed on the DEX so the cost to develop should be split, not fully funded by Decred.
3. One of the justifications for this proposal is that it will increase liquidity, but as objection #1 states it's quite a risky bet. There is a much more measurable method to increase liquidity (and thus indirectly increase market cap): designated market making (DMM) (https://sci-hub.tw/10.1017/S0022109000004166). Of course I am biased, but I don't agree with the objections given to using a DMM (and the empirical evidence backs me up):
> The conventional solution to this problem is to pay a market maker (""MM"") to make your project's market on one or more exchanges, and this typically costs USD 30K / mo or more and gives the MM an enormous amount of control over the market price of your asset.  

$30,000 seems a lot at first, but when you realise that empirically DMM's add 5+% to your market cap, that means it'd be worth about $7m to Decred as a whole and ~$12.5k/month of additional funds to the treasury alone. For further info on valuing liquidity and market makers, the introduction of this paper provides a good meta analysis of the research already available: https://sci-hub.tw/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2154699. I further argue the price manipulation standpoint. Using a DMM increases market depth and would actually make DCR less susceptible to market manipulation. That said, there are a lot of valid concerns regarding choosing a DMM which you have raised on Slack. There are many unscrupulous crypto DMMs out there (even some very well known ones). You have to really know what you're doing when it comes to the contract negotiation (namely, spread guarantees, uptime, and sizes shown at various levels).","82f197a914dd8bab17c341ea8a6e5d2de2d53efc04b0e63163c15163f663281b8f5c28cce729a1e8a48919f85ffdee2b0f5027720d78b3863316e173130ca005","58e6c6676b5b75f00ece826b63e185f961c3acb49319806d9f103f920190a556","24","95c05c8dcf47b28908824ce6296c88b0c24539f3e54d21d9ac472d2ec265f71b9607fd7ec34a5fead0d6aed0db34c6083171a1931ea5fab9044dabf269167200",1549563033,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/24",-1,15,7,8,1

- Socializing the merits of Decred as a SOV to venture, institutional, and other investor groups.  And courting asset management intermediaries that are building solutions to cater to institutional investors

IMO this is a complicated matter because the points you present are valid. However they remain valid only when the objective is to maintain and foster the current ecosystem, with the same actors and incentives. 

Personally, I can't stand KYC, trading fees, and trusting tiers. I have years of bad experiences with exchanges, banks,  financial and/or CC services who are built with the only goal of artificially extracting more money from you.

The reason I got in cryptocurrencies is because I want out of this. I see every effort made to re-create the same structures and incentives as ways to hold back evolution and change.

At some point we will need a real DEX if we have any hope of changing these structures. And not the closed source, intermediary token, fee grabbing attempts we see now.

For me a real DEX would not be operated by a single party, would not require a single wallet and would be open source and possible to integrate freely in any wallet or app for any CC without requiring a central entity or fees and there would be no actors for regulators to potentially mess with and hinder functionality in the future. Unfortunately I have absolutely no confidence in any of the existing ""DEX"" projects out there to achieve this...


On the question of whether the Decred stakeholders should use the treasury to fund this project, we'll see how the vote turns out. The things I'm considering now are :

- We are in a unique position in this space that we have the ability to build a ""real"" DEX. If we don't, who & when does someone will?
- For how long can we go without a real DEX before it become a real issue for innovation? Or do we just accept past and current structures as inevitable?
- There's risk in using a sizeable part of our treasury.
- We are in a bear market and the effective cost would be higher now.
- In a bull market it would be cheaper but don't we wish there was a ""real"" DEX when the time comes.


This one really isn't easy for stakeholders. ;)

An inherent mechanism to swap tokens easily is an essential piece of this technology, which allows it  to become completely independant of the legacy (centralized) world. The direct benefit for Decred might not seem big, but the **indirect consequences are going to be**:

- If this DEX takes off by proofing its fairness, it could turn Decred into kind of a major base pair
- Decred can proof to be innovative and therefore valuable - more than LTC and one day even more than BTC
- Decred might become a nodal point in the cryptocurrency ecosystem by building base technology, NOT being exclusive and allowing other projects to attach

However, I do see **two significant issues** to be worked on:

- A fair price discovery (making sure everybody receives fair prices and is not screwed, even if one is not a trader) requires high liquidity. With this proposal I see a very fragmented marketplace landscape - each server with its own order book and low volume. Do I understand correctly, that the servers do not share orders to build one huge liquid market? 
- Servers might not be able to operate in a sustainable way with one-time account fees? This is especially bad, if my previous point is correct. Because, then the best market servers with high liquidity (probably many users) would have the biggest issues to finance opeartion long-term.","9d03ba3b2283639e954161dbec2df1285880c8744b8c08d780d234ad41f6cb426e619275f4095513686cf68b1fe481516a31fb42dacf11c487ac1859814c750b","04eef072313a74989d19e1253709ca10ddb706b9210634da31c6c39aa92ed94c","33","4be18ff7cd0c4efd181fb110610315b71728f3db212da61c8fa91bb765d01030178570754a965187913773692fc11bc88f7ed3b360f1a461a09918050d2ca20b",1549720889,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/33",6,8,7,1,1

This is a great technological demonstration for Decred. I feel somewhere that the fact that Decred did the majority of the ground work for atomic swaps has been lost to common crypto folks.

1. **Exchange via atomic swaps appeals only to a very particular demographic of traders — institutional block trading**. Why is a retail trader or proprietary trading firm going to use the DEX?

2. This DEX would essentially be a market data network — ****How is each node going to share market data from server to server at scale and globally?** How are prices going to be in sync in a distributed system across many time zones without one centralized server?
**
3. No high-frequency trading will be possible via atomic swaps — **High frequency trading provides the vast majority of liquidity in traditional markets - where is liquidity going to come from on the DEX?**

4. Understood that we want to disintermediate centralized exchanges and create a trading utopia without trading fees, but **we are forgetting that exchange fees have value because exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc) can use those fees to offer new services to appeal to more demographics of traders. Hence, at the very least, it is important for the DEX to be revenue producing for the Decred network fund**. The DEX could charge a very small fee that atomic-swaps into DCR and that fee auto-sends back into the network fund.

5) Lastly, **the DEX project is very expensive and DCR is on it's lows** — better to table it for now and sleep on it some more -- maybe bring it up again later when the network fund is in better shape. There are many other aspects of the Decred network to work on in the meantime 👍

I'd much rather spend the funds on DCR directly to make it better. 

Plus, many don't use DEX's currently and would rather wait until another DEX is accepted by the masses and use some funds to get listed there.  Or if no other DEX proves to be worthy in a year or 2 when the market recovers, we proceed with this plan then.  

I'd be fine with pitching in for a community DEX, but I do understand that would take longer and be more complicated.

I'll preface my comments with the following note; people tend to conflate the idea of the DEX with ""market making"" (which in crypto takes place in a very different manner than in traditional markets whereby liquidity providers usually make use of their own inventory), suggesting that all initiatives to increase liquidity are similar or that only one approach can be put into play.  I am personally a proponent of a multifaceted strategy, MM/DEX are not mutually exclusive and I would like to elucidate why a DEX will bring a degree of resilience to the Decred market that can not be replicated even by increasing the volume of DCR traded by one or more orders of magnitude on traditional exchanges.

Having DCR trade on a decentralized exchange which eliminates counterparty risk from the equation will bring a different type of liquidity and depth to the market that I believe very few coins actually have. A healthy order book will have tons of bids, many of them being ""lowballs"" (bidding for DCR at a price that is significantly below the last print). All that might seem useless but it is actually very beneficial and shows confidence in the asset.

Now say a user wants to bid for $1M USD of DCR (in BTC terms) at $5 (which is a steep discount to that last trade of $17), what that entails on a traditional exchange is exposing that $1M USD of BTC to counterparty risk, as the exchange can go under, be hacked, flag your account for ""suspicious activity"" and deny you access to your funds. In short, there are a myriad of ways which you can be screwed, even with the best centralized exchanges, making the most conservative way to use them  look like:

1. Send a small chunk of BTC to the exchange
2. Trade BTC for DCR
3. Withdraw DCR
4. GOTO 1

So you in essence only remove liquidity from the exchange and there is little incentive to be a price maker as the time your funds are exposed to the counterparty increases your risk profile. The strategy outlined above requires you to break up your trade to manage the risk, then rinse and repeat until you have acquired the size you desire. There is no reason to place bids or asks that are not anticipated to be filled in the immediate future. You are also likely to be required to go through the KYC/AML dance as there are very few exchanges that will allow users to transact without first being vetted.

Now putting on my investor hat for a moment another issue comes to the fore; having the ability to exit a position is even more important than the process by which you acquire it. Any investor worth their salt will want to be able to get an idea of what their position is actually worth. E.g., if you wake up at 3 AM and decide to sell, how much slippage will there be and can the market absorb your size? This is where the order book starts to become important. Even in the case of coins that do very healthy amounts of volume, it is quite evident that a great deal of the bids or asks can disappear at a moments notice when they appear at risk of getting a fill. In essence, many orders on centralized exchanges are placed by bots with no intention of ever following through with a trade, they exist solely to create the illusion of liquidity and trick the user into a false sense of security. These same types of bots are in many instances also able to take advantage of unsophisticated traders that place market orders, by frontrunning them (essentially acting as scalpers), but I will not get into that issue as this post has already become overly verbose.

So to put it succinctly, what a DEX buys us is a place where the actual health of the Decred market can be gauged. I have no illusions about massive amounts of volume materializing on day one, however I think having the infrastructure to disintermediate the centralized exchanges will put the project in a unique position to entice players that would traditionally not be adding liquidity to throw their hat in the ring, as the risks of participating in the market are significantly diminished.","0f140e75af29407d3c63df0269d212a8e23e6c497c54f2a252a8e7692bd3e868cf42a1be38ea44eceb9ebe63a8328a94ca879100ab5ba3e4f22e43366a3c0809","db4f9959fdc395bf2db48e1992d58d5366f05397345e3985b901b0294993a6f8","47","b8f6db5b930f953d46615ba09a600012c4f1996c0ae31e8b0896161a613afd3dbf17185b126066f6fcf05f72ddb9a88054954f88ab449375ff7f471846b33c02",1550462264,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/47",10,10,10,0,0

> Multiple times some ""large holders"" were referenced who are interested in this DEX. It would help a lot if couple entities step up and reveal their passion (or even commitment) to use this DEX, e.g. Iterative, Placeholder, etc. If we only knew more about ""Yocom-Piatt confirmed that a number of large DCR stakeholders have expressed interest in a product that prevents such slippage."" (source)

I am not going to comment further regarding who has expressed interest in using the DEX extensively since it would be a violation of their privacy, IMO.

> How reusable this DEX tech will be for LN-based atomic swap trading?

Since LN is very low latency, I expect that the order matching algorithm might need to change.  The format of limit orders would have to change as well because they would not be backed by UTXOs, but rather funds stored in LN channels.  These are non-trivial changes, but much of the overall architecture could remain the same.

> Why do you think it makes sense to start DEX sooner rather than wait e.g. a year?

It will take a while to get the MVP ready, it will take several weeks or months to get some decent liquidity going, etc.  The sooner we start this process, the sooner there can be real progress made on the liquidity front.

> Is it possible/feasible to adjust the pace of work to market conditions? e.g. when market is bad slow down and spend less?

Yes, there is no reason this needs to be completed as fast as possible.

> Is it possible to prepare an ability to pause the project after certain key deliverables (""checkpoints"")?

I don't think committing to this is a good idea unless there is another serious dip in the exchange rate.

> What aspects of the proposal facilitate integration with existing trading actors? I assume open protocols, but perhaps some tools can be built to specifically ease integration job.

MMs can show up, setup shop, and the project and they do  not have to worry about counterparty risk at the exchange.

> How about time-locking orders so that they cannot be quickly removed? This could stop even more games and make the order book even more ""real"".

Making the matching process difficult to game, i.e. fairer, strikes me as fixing the most glaring problem with markets.  Overuse of cancellations of limit orders is obviously not a good thing, but I think time-locks would create on-chain bloat and go too far in terms of tieing traders' hands.

> There were concerns that DEX work will slow down other developments, and the rebuttal was something like ""the DEX won't have any impact on c0 roadmap"". Is it certain that c0 will not be building the DEX? Also, even if not directly developing the DEX I expect some review and coordination effort will happen to work with the DEX contractor - any estimate on that?

After some internal discussion, C0 could generate the engineering specifications without too much effort, but I am not interested in having us write the DEX client and server.  I would very much like to have a non-C0 contractor or group of contractors perform that work.

> Does the budget include marketing/PR expenses to promote the DEX, or will this be covered by Decred's PR budget?

To date, we've kept our marketing expenses pretty limited, with an eye to reaching audiences at trade shows and via trade publications and other media.  I would not expect it to be necessary to budget for marketing exclusively for the DEX.  Provided it has decent liquidity, it could be the subject of some articles in trade publications and other media, which doesn't create a large incremental marketing/PR cost.","10239d81c44bdd62015979dd564bc03f78344acbc9ed9ca23ebae85f27db0734febe00508955571fb8d916325418957464cb1bab88fe92fceb1173abe9e1b40f","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","61","73f736b3fb29eb47098560eeb362a2fc29878dcb588c733db7b21cf8acd8c77b82bedf32948242493f32c52d473bfae3a8e678df2fcfaef0527dc70d9a95c40f",1550632886,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a/comments/61",3,3,3,0,0

This purpose of this project is to understand and track the activity on Politeia. A better understanding of how the proposals site is being used will inform the interpretation of its outputs and decisions about how Pi is developed.

#### Products

- Processed data from Politeia, and code to do the processing, available to all in accessible forms
- Reproducible analyses, statistics and charts
- Write-ups that offer interpretation of the data

This [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/pi-research) has been created to organize and track the work and its readme has a more complete description of what this will involve, plus some ideas for analysis and early work on a few aspects.

I think there is a useful discussion to be had here about how much introspective analysis of Politeia data is productive. In-depth user analysis (either at the level of Pi account or on-chain tickets) in particular is something I would like to hear the community's thoughts on.","c7c839866cd0e0d52428e40591af02d2c06fb8a22ea552462042a2387cdba23a8491f1146bdd7e1b0ed0db63caa8cf0cbf107e4197c84156a7575ca159af4e08","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","1","e0e18ce4fbca5767600b2154c032ef353c20d455f208ca8aa4155c77ca7c73dac6b8e781528e1500ba93656140583da1fe6b35d645cd4f4ee0d4d78e7c29ae02",1543271509,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/1",14,14,14,0,1

The purpose of this project is to understand how social media coverage of cryptocurrencies works, and how Decred is performing relative to its peers. 

Platforms like reddit and twitter seem to be quite influential in the cryptocurrency space, but it can be difficult to understand how they work in practice. 

This project would be about collecting data from a set of platforms and using it to address questions of interest.

Platforms:

- Reddit - data from reddit is easy to access, I have already [started](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/reddit1.md) to [explore](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/blob/master/reddit/readme.md) what kind of analysis is useful.
- Twitter - data is harder to access and collect. I would be interested in seeing network analysis of who follows/likes/re-tweets who, and what the components of the network look like.
- GitHub - not exactly social media but has some of the same features and is quite amenable to detailed analysis. @degeri is already [working on](https://github.com/degeri/decred_contributor_track) a way to identify first-time Decred contributors automatically through GitHub for the Journal.

The purpose would be addressing questions like:

- How do different projects use the same platform? What kind of value do they gain from the platform? Is there anything Decred can learn from their approach?
- Is it possible to identify attempts at manipulating or gaming the platform? 

I have created a [repository](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/analysis/) with exploratory work on reddit, it would probably make sense to start new repositories for research on other platforms.","09b889982f4cbf826f89e68f0d761c6a8004ba1cfe57491690656e5de295b0b42307321faadd0dcebf343ba105089913b3fe4279a92e7f5c0c73960a93937d03","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","2","378f778b75c96a64089b72331313242e25dd156a1f7680abb1dd017143fcb8e5abe49590410f182ef9906af4980ae7d97e12d7728d8cc98a6974b45fb2f53d0f",1543271615,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/2",6,10,8,2,1

Specifically with regard to **governance**, if this is truly decentralized and permissionless we should be able to identify open public spaces and fora for each project where deliberation is occurring and decisions are being made. Without such spaces where outsiders can follow and understand decision-making, there is a significant barrier between those on the inside making the decisions, and those on the outside. In that case the best that insiders can hope to do is to accurately interpret the needs of the other stakeholders and act in a way they think is fair.

In my view building a successful cryptocurrency movement requires acquainting many more people with the fundamentals the technology. Only on this basis can people act as effective guardians of the networks. The best way to achieve this is with a role people can productively play, and incentives!

Decred's approach is excellent in this regard:

- Granting stakeholders a quantifiable say in decision-making that cuts across every aspect of the project through both the on-chain consensus voting and Politeia proposals
- Incentivising participation with voting rewards, for ticket voters.
- Incentivising participation with treasury funds, for contributors who work on the project and generate value for the project and space

Any project that wants to be resistant to social attacks should be pursuing the same kinds of aims. I think it would be very worthwhile to track where all of this activity is happening in the space and start developing a better collective view on what is going on.

For projects where it is not possible to identify such open public spaces, and where ""the team"" are effectively walled off from the community by handlers - that would probably signify more of a centralized/hierarchical/corporate production model. 

I have been thinking about how to build a resource like this, and I hope to put together a prototype for what that could look like in the not too distant future. I think the whole space could benefit from a clear overview of the attributes of each project, the tradeoffs being made, and links to key venues or sources.

I see the social media analysis suggested here as a starting point, the data is quite easily accessible and standardized between projects, so makes for an easy entry-point to understanding some aspects of the  communities and how they organize (or don't).","0d707cf6a8f805f4b0ee6b7f1e28eba325de7d8b96a6af6fc23f0741b766e300b63bd81acfd0a8861afaf1a6aa855a4dcae65bc7e3f311652b0d530cdbe3be08","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","3","ab6aee356bc9d9579348bc914e2a727df0dc76db0816b12f531f7a01621f06d027625f803e2948cc0ac7df442f87d81a4969b6e902f806f03af972893bab9106",1543272531,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/3",3,3,3,0,1

Visions and potentials for how dcrtime and Politeia have been shared.  Examples include [Jake at MIT](https://events.technologyreview.com/video/watch/jake-yocom-piatt-decred-blockchain-sovereignty/) giving a straight forward presentation, the fascinating ideas during the [Politeia Challenge](https://medium.com/@slgoss04/decreds-politeia-challenge-took-place-february-10th-at-the-hyatt-regency-in-austin-texas-482986b75a18) and even the classic [Politeia Use Cases EP4 of Decred Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oQYmLx0eTg) which aired over a year ago now.

We are using Politeia and dcrtime and it works great.  The success should be viewed like the Mars landing.  This is a very big deal and frankly other projects are missing out by not utilizing these tools and the practically free blockchain anchoring and pre-built authorization abilities in Politeia.

A lot of other things are also going right.  A quick search of what good [readme files](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) should look like on open source projects or a deep dive into the code in the [politeia code](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui) illustrates we have solid repositories and excellent code commenting.

Is the extended community interested in looking at how to better support the development team that has built these tools in advocating for their usage?  If so, are we interested in researching some basic questions?  Here are a few examples that could be looked at:

1. What are projects today doing as best practice to attract usage?
2. What do business integration companies working with other products today want that has not been built out (specifications? documentation? technical briefs? media/materials?)?

Crytpocurrency news outlets frequently report on merchants who have recently started to accept bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as payment for their goods/services in countries such as Venezuela (1) and it appears as though this is one of the most compelling use cases for cryptocurrencies to facilitate payments.

Decred is likely to be well suited as an exchange medium or form of payment for goods and services given its transaction fees, mobile wallet support and transaction times. 

The aim of this research is to investigate the following:
(i) how, why and in what way are cryptocurrencies currently used in countries such as Venezuela (or others with an unstable fiat currency)
(ii) is there an opportunity for Decred usage to increase in any such countries?
(iii) If so, what does Decred need in order to increase its usage?

Suggested lines of inquiry:
- What is the prevelance of cryptocurrency as a payment method in countries with unstable currencies and macroeconomic indicators
- In which sectors/industries are merchants most likely to accept cryptocurrency for payment
- What are the most popular ways in which consumers acquire cryptocurrency?

The example questions are interesting, but without proposed methodologies it is difficult to evaluate whether they are the best questions to ask.

For this subject, I think I would want to hear from _potential users_ of dcrtime/politeia about whether they are interested in the features that this software offers. 

Who are these _potential users_? Well, I think that's something we should consider first in some depth. Who do we think could benefit from dcrtime? What kind of uses would we like to promote?

If we know who the potential users are, we could come up with a methodology that involves reaching out to those groups in some way, making them aware of dcrtime and what it can do - and _then_ asking our questions about whether they're interested and what the likely impediments would be.

Collect and evaluate coverage of Decred in ""the media"". This research can inform us about how Decred performs in the press and whether we should adjust our outreach/marketing efforts. This is different from _social media research_ proposed in another comment.

A prototype of a building block for this already exists: [decred-media-tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) -- a collaboratively maintained dataset of links to Decred coverage along with some metadata. Some examples of what it makes possible:

* statistics
  * how many pieces of content are generated per week/month
  * which domains and authors post more or less about Decred
  * stats for countries and languages
* deeper analysis from following the links (some can be automated):
  * assess quality of content, including factual errors
  * categorize the subject of the article
  * analyze the keywords/SEO
  * use techniques like sentiment analysis or topic modeling
* independent researchers can build on top of it

Before seriously engaging with the media tracker [several issues](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker/issues) need to be figured out, and discussion with Ditto is desirable to learn their ways of measuring media performance.","e363c8a0482b5356b1893134241407abab194a10e2b426c02216aff0d33e270e0449758c2d0035aa8168f19bde0735d8c8536e2bc870ac969e46d401e439630a","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","13","5ea0edeff7f2cd974f65d644de9c7d33abf0ffc4324cda2594e341c1ab42a7dc57004248b5028ff6df1316e8e7bf3b3d825d0f568fa80d4323c9a355d2513108",1543526446,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/13",6,6,6,0,1

Study and watch governance models outside Decred. Analyze and report successes, failures and any interesting events. Contrast other models with Decred. The goal is to learn from external experience and borrow good ideas.

Both on-chain (formal, consensus layer) and off-chain (informal, social level) processes are considered.

This may overlap with _cryptocurrency social media_ research outlined in another comment because some processes occur on platforms like Reddit, Twitter or GitHub.

In my view one of the most important aspects is clearly identifying the public spaces where governance discussions and decision-making take place. I don't think it is possible to assess how well a project is governed without observing that governance in action. If you can't point to the locations where a project's governance takes place, participation is probably not open and permissionless.","fbdd3590a311af9a68133f0f38a2ad2fabdbec144c63b60bda286dd8402542aa8f76d43b2c16b26d64c493f05b0f5618dbace19e8b0e2ae18b9be725a5a6e808","cd6e57b93f95dd0386d670c7ce42cb0ccd1cd5b997e87a716e9359e20251994e","16","6a76100017cbfdd2b596ef8d520c29ff6a56efc5d2dbe503c7fe5b19361b380a166201ad0bf51d17d749007ba20aff03eeec2fa0fe15b39fcc7eaaf9b9de240d",1543535164,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/16",4,4,4,0,1

- Reddit
- GitHub
- IRC
- Forums
- Slack
- Matrix
- Discord
- Telegram
- Custom (e.g. Politeia)

I'm not sure how viable this idea is but it strikes me that Decred is unique in that it has a POS layer in which funds are functionally ""locked up"" in exchange for a voting right. If the locked up funds could be 'used' somehow to provide additional 'features' such as privacy in addition to securing the right to vote, a win-win situation could be achieved.

The research question is thus: Is it possible to increase the role of staked funds such that ""locked"" funds can increase the privacy of Decred (e.g using a 'coin join' technique or something else novel).","4369911c9e910f6700afd7968f3721b93515d5faa9f5e2d025177c2092e25ae5cf470ab487d14ffb474506558a423ea0c23d867fd744aa735754af84f30d8e07","5d5565d8b11a0357e19c021bcb67177e43c8eb655e4037bdfd8dc9489fc71c45","19","ea82eab85cdfeabc208d7a2757896f0c27588eba14f7f1c2c81714b37f06abd659d418684f5db826d4072ca54a156c53e11913f281d762059ef689b187dc8106",1543550940,0,0,FALSE,NA,"5d9cfb07aefb338ba1b74f97de16ee651beabc851c7f2b5f790bd88aea23b3cb/comments/19",-3,3,0,3,0

My bet is that the gained network effect would cancel / outweight the negative effects of people dumping the airdropped coins.

1. Deleterious to network effects of nascent currencies wrt Metcalfe or (much better IMO) transactome-informed network capital theory (see Gogerty's work) 
2. A/B testing of different technical, economic or philosophical approaches (""let the market decide"")
3. An inevitability of entropy and/or finite social scalability as these networks grow and mature it is difficult to keep all stakeholders sufficiently aligned for optimal network health.

As such, protocol-layer fork resistance and effective public fora with voting mechanisms can certainly be helpful tools, but I suppose there is a question as to whether the so-called tyranny of the majority should be exercised in all cases. If there was a ""block size"" style civil war in Decred with no acceptable compromise in sight, is the status quo still the best situation in all cases?

Disclaimer: I have an ongoing research project studying forks from a variety of perspectives and Decred's fork-resistance got a nod in the manuscript. Going to revisit it again soon. So I am biased :)

It is a rather nuanced topic but I will hopefully be able to precis it here.

As part of my investigations on the above topic [http://asymmetries.pllel.com], I have been involved as a ""Pollinator"" in the DAO Stack Alchemy Genesis AlphaDAO - their semi-centralised testing bed. As part of this some erstwhile collaborators who are ""DAO & Governance"" specialists are part of a unit funded by the GenesisDAO named the ""Accountability Task Force (ATF). See us on a panel at the Web3 Summit Hackerspace here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipPErp0UM0]

As this DAO is funded by, allocates funds to successful proposals AND pays them natively in ETH with no indexing or mitigation for cryptoasset price voltatility. This is obviously in contrast to what happens in Decred, with DCR being the payment method via treasury but with nominal cashflows being indexed to USD value.

Due to the rather pronounced decline in the fiat price of cryptoassets recently, the latest and supposedly final proposal to continue funding the ATF for 2 more months at a cost of 50 ETH has created a huge amount of contention and debate. People asking for it to be rescinded (mainnet on-chain so not possible), others downvoting including head of DAOStack Matan Field, others asking for more accountability on funding spend, yet others asking for refund. IMO many people still have last winter's prices in their heads. Personally, I voted for it, to see the resolution of the experiment, and because I don't consider ETH to be a monetary asset or have a long-term value proposition.

What is really fascinating is that part of the ATF's remit is to map out social attack vectors in DAOs, and people started to ask if this was a simulated attack :) They said no, and I genuinely believe it not to be, but who can say. 

It somewhat leads to the notion that DAOs and ""human governance"" are at odds with each other. I also had a front-row seat for that other DAO (TheDAO) having been a token holder. I am super interested to see how things work out here and have been passing on tips to the GenesisDAO reflecting some of the best practises I see in Decred - for example suggesting pricing / payout of proposals in DAI rather than ETH.

There is some merit in the idea that exchanges should pay money to cryptocurrencies they list (including Decred). Not because of who of them is more popular, but due to the fundamental fact that cryptocurrencies come first, exchanges come second.

Coins can exist without exchanges, but exchanges cannot exist without coins. Cryptocurrencies are more complex, require more skill to maintain, have much higher cost of programming mistake (whole network compromised vs one exchange compromised), while exchanges get hacked and lose money much more often. Cryptos embody the spirit of freedom and privacy while exchanges are primarily focused on making money, which forces them to obey sanctions and relentlessly KYC clients. The idea to eliminate trading fees by [Decred DEX](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a) is such a bold move.

Note that I'm not saying that exchanges don't bring any value to the ecosystem, they bring a lot. I'm just saying that fundamentally they are secondary to cryptocurrencies. Also note that I only mean serious cryptocurrencies, which excludes some 95% of the market.","08342abfe847188810567ddd9d24d33debcca94862d6042350c42d7c7f3e82cfe015f9b13441752156de52a63dcc38d38893170a29919346c9b75cfcc0dee90c","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","30","6e69ec2fb6089db25ad88d1d94be412993e76a3990eff937734724faf44ab4954d26d2df1dcf8ae05aa540967ec098e2d6d501cd8034e60bd015f80e0b18570d",1551519097,0,0,FALSE,NA,"60adb9c0946482492889e85e9bce05c309665b3438dd85cb1a837df31fbf57fb/comments/30",2,2,2,0,1

I appreciate that FTL talked about bitcoin early.  That is different to me than paying them to talk about us.  Gavin may have expressed appreciation about FTL getting the word out about Bitcoin early on...but that is very different than Bitcoin sponsoring FTL early on.

If we choose to sponsor FTL we would in some eyes be financially supporting a political stance/ethos.  Regardless of the alignment with the community (and I'm guessing there is at least some) that will have an impact.  One possibility if there is high alignment (and I don't really know if there is or not) is a ""echo chamber syndrome"" we see in controlled feeds today where we attract people who think like the majority of the community and thus we grow only in that small subset of political thinking even though the technology is fundamentally useful and attractive to the larger whole (what is libertarian now...10% of Americans (and based on my brief investigation I believe that the show is basically ""American Libertarian"" which is different than most forms of libertarianism globally: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism))

Some questions I have:
- Have you worked with other digital currencies in the past? (Dash, Monero)
- How many new users can we expect to add to our network based on this ad package? I understand this would be difficult to measure, but surely you have some experience with click-through rates?
- Is there a way to verify how many users are tuned-in to the show at a given time (in particular during the Decred ads)?
- How does this ad package compare to other radio shows? For example how much would it cost to advertise via national public radio?

I agree with this statement:

1. Yes, we have worked with Bitcoin.com, HoriZen (ZenCash), Monero, and Dash. On top of that, we have worked with MANY crypto businesses and crypto accepting businesses. We got in early and are considered to be a market maker in that segment. 

2. No telling. Advertising is an art, not a science. We are audio. We don't have click-through rates. This is the biggest problem with audio ads: they are hard to track. Also, I imagine these as branding ads, not direct response. Branding ads are intended to create a reputation and keep your product top of mind. Can you think of a jingle for a product from your youth? If you can, branding was successful. 

I can guarantee that your ads will be heard on 190+ US radio stations, 2 satellite channels, dozens of streams, get 100,000+/monthly podcast downloads resulting millions of listening sessions per month, but I can't give you any kind of results, other than many advertisers stay with us month after month. 

3. The show is heard on many platforms. The biggest are radio and podcast. Neilson rates radio listening and that is how we get our estimates. General numbers are available on the Internet, but we don't pay the $30k per year for the use of the more specific numbers. I can give you screenshots of our podcast downloads 

4. We are A LOT less expensive than any other Top 30 radio program that I have ever seen. Like 1/10th as much. Like I said in the presentation, we did well and don't have to take advertisers that we don't want, and we don't have much of a sales department either. So, our rates are low, but we are making enough to keep broadcasting. So, things are fine. 

I just did a quick google search on underwriting costs for NPR. It looks like you can get a nice web-banner on their site (No on air presence at all) for the cost of this package. I don't know if that 20 grand would get you a banner for a month or a year. https://www.nationalpublicmedia.com/get-started/

FTL is the best value in advertising, especially if you want to hit males in the US. 

4. Ditto is a PR firm. Usually PR firms attempt to get you interviews, they don't place ads, generally. That is the job of an ad agency. I have lots of critiques of ad agencies, after 20 years in this business. We can talk about that too, if you want. :-)

This proposal is for a full radio/podcast live ad package which includes 30 second recorded audio ads promoting Decred to our national and international audience.  It also includes live (not recorded) promotions of Decred during our show segments.  Our show airs live and recorded on over 190 radio stations at various times, but we are not on ""throughout the day"", so we can't run ads outside of our showtimes.  The stations air other shows during other times of the day and we cannot control the ads that run during those other shows.

John, thanks for your questions. There are 2 main ways to listen to the show: the live version and the recorded version. The Live promotions are at least :60 seconds in length, and are part of the show, as opposed to a recorded ad. So, they are heard on both versions of the show. The :30 podcast ads are heard in the recorded version only. The :30 second radio ads are heard in the live version. If you wonder “Why not have the ads that air in the live version just air in the recorded one too?” The answer is that podcast audiences have a much lower tolerance for ads than do live listeners. 

Obviously, these numbers are estimates. Because of the way that radio listeners are quantified (they are counted by the 15-minute listening segment, not by the 3-hour radio program) we can claim millions of listens per month. That isn’t a perfect way to count, but neither is by the listener. A listener could be a person that listens to the whole show on podcast, on the treadmill at the gym or it could be a mom in the car for 10 minutes with screaming kids. The short answer to your question is about 250,000 weekly listeners. We don’t count daily because different days of the week have different audience size.","d627dd9da5ee54ead25b952177f7a307f4d06d37fd6490c825acecc83cc79a93399bd0af5f14d038d16d81a79cbe50af134e7d66e89873be2221dbb53da2d406","b719b0bee46a2fb08a1d31f5b81577f886c1d51707da860645757ea28cc19e03","25","751a2d8b132eef73cdbfef079434b3a3818db5afcc451af86f703b6f8dbee7d8b086bc9530f90904ca3744e61c89a1ad725827c3ca85f30852bc846f8ca76103",1543960135,0,0,FALSE,NA,"7fe5d07a4ffff7dc6a83383018823d880b1c1db0a29305e74934817cf2b4e2ce/comments/25",2,2,2,0,0

There are some inaccuracies here. Yes, we had a DASH proposal. We advertised them for close to 2 years and then they began focusing on Venezuela and we parted ways. The DASH proposal expires this month, but it went live months ago and they are not currently on the air with us.  I was clear in my responses here that DASH HAD been an advertiser. That is what we do, we are a radio program and we sell ads. DASH’s slot is available and we offered it to y’all. There have been some months that we get 85% of our revenue from crypto. We are a show that is friendly to crypto. 

Yes, the price is different from the previous DASH proposal because pricing for crypto has gone down recently. If it goes down after this proposal is approved, we still will provide the ads that we offered at the price we promised. 

Yes, we modified this proposal from our DASH proposal. Why is that bad? It is a good proposal that lays out our Major Sponsor proposal quite well. You can find our packages here: https://www.freetalklive.com/advertise. 

If a car salesman sells 2 different people the same make/model and color of car, I don’t think anyone would call it a scandal. 

Regarding Smartcash: That IS NOT an active proposal. It was just me seeing what they would have to say. I wanted to see what would happen here first, but again, is there a problem with us having 2 up-and-coming cryptos as advertisers? Should I include an exclusivity option here?

Here is what Liz Bagot (Ditto AVP) posted in Slack regarding this proposal: 

> The question was put to Ditto in the marketing channel, and I wanted to post it here as well. We've been asked to weigh in on the radio proposal in Politeia, and here's what we think:

> Generally, we recommend an integrated approach in which we know the message, who we want to say it to, and where those people are. Maybe it’s radio, maybe it’s not. If you’re going for broad awareness, it may make sense down the line to go for a broader radio play. However, we think paid advertising is premature at this stage — we have yet to work through Decred’s branding and messaging, which we need to nail down and make airtight before we approach the broader public. For the sake of putting on a solid public front, we need to agree on how best to tell the Decred story and position ourselves, both internally and externally. This is the first order of business for Decred’s work with Ditto — and what we’ll be discussing with a couple Decred folks this Thursday. We recommend focusing on getting the free earned media stuff first (which Ditto has already started). Once we’ve established a strong external narrative, we can consider how and if paid opportunities might complement our efforts.

So with this feedback, I am willing to vote no for now, but wouldn't be opposed to this proposal in the next few months once Ditto has done their work and we are ready to spread our message to the masses.

Implementing this proposal in the current form is against what I perceive as Decred ethos. But I do like your contributions to cryptocurrency, your audience and your network. Full length shows and interviews, or even commentary, would be great to broadcast.

Long version below.

I very like concept, but not the format:

> Per show, this means Decred receives three (3) :30 second recorded radio ads, one :30 podcast ad and one (1) live promotion per show. For the recorded ads, we’ll use different voices. This, we feel, helps function as a sort of “Word of Mouth” campaign. Listeners hear the same message repeated by many different people.

This is my biggest concern for this proposal. 30 second ads sound like cheap shilling. What deep, thoughtful information can one squeeze in 30 seconds? I don't want to see ""Decred ads"" or even ""promotion"". I'd love to see full time shows and interviews that explain why Decred is so amazing, e.g. ""Decred is one of the few places where you can have real sovereignty"". I don't want sovereignty to be packaged into a product that can be sold in 30 seconds. Using different voices for 30 second ads makes it even worse, it sounds like mind manipulation. You can't fake a ""word of mouth"", and if you can, I don't want it that way. Sorry this sounds harsh, but when reading first time it raised my eyebrows so I wanted to share what I feel.

I'm also not sure about the banners because I hate all ads that interrupt my thoughts, and always filter them.

That said, I do like the concept of using radio in general. I cannot verify all claims, but if they are true I am thankful and respectful for doing a big contribution to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency movement.

What would be great instead is to have full length shows and interviews with our community members because they understand and can explain Decred well. There are a lot of topics to cover like sovereignty, skin in the game, conflicts of interest, aligned incentives, forks, ASIC resistance, misconceptions about PoW energy usage, ICOs, Politeia's resistance to manupulation and more. News from Decred space would be great too, we have [quite a lot](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/) going on! Another approach is commentary on what happens in the space.

The only short ""ads"" I would tolerate is announcements of the shows so more people don't miss it, e.g. inserting ""By the way tomorrow at X we will have Y tell us Decred's approach to Z"" at the end of a block about Z.

@oregonisaac raised a good point that sponsoring the whole radio can be interpreted by the public as sponsoring certain political stance/ethos. We shall be really careful about our messaging, and it is impossible to audit everything that happens on the radio. One way to address this is to pay only for the shows and not sponsor the whole radio.

What I liked:

* General concept of using radio.
* Past contribution to Decred - show with Marco. I haven't listened to it, but the sole fact of its existence is nice.
* Past contribution to cryptocurrency space.
* Libertarian audience sounds like it aligns with Decred. I'm not 100% sure as I don't know them. I hope they are not zealots - we need people who think for themselves.
* The price looks reasonable for the network of your size.
* Appreciate how you engaged in comments.

Notes:

* "":30 second"" reads a bit confusing, just ""30 second"" would do.

If this proposal is voted No, a reworked iteration can be posted later and I would suggest to focus it on non-ad content.","370da2f315e6746c4f1dc69d3a4cf635143ce09ab04b5b5ee61aec033e56f58d3f72351ff89cf17d24b3932f1fccea938b306b3d324b6122474616b3a8eb2006","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","41","46e416699d2ee3b2aecdcbf5d7b361e4f404f6e9177cd17f8b085ab1a639bfac13927fad3dc5d31f1bea92d5149972ed3e0a2dda76d8830ddaae298094589205",1544079623,0,0,FALSE,NA,"7fe5d07a4ffff7dc6a83383018823d880b1c1db0a29305e74934817cf2b4e2ce/comments/41",3,5,4,1,1

It is a good idea, but your suggestions on implementation very likely won’t work. You want to change the format of a very successful, 16 year old, radio program, #27 in the nation with millions of monthly listens, to fit your preferences. Sure, everyone wants to do that. We have a dog vitamin supplement company that has advertised with us for years. I would bet, if asked, they would love us to talk all about dog health and stuff. The reality is that if we did such a thing, it would destroy listenership. I can't make the Decred Show, I can't even make the Crypto Show. It won't fly, or at least I don't believe that it would fly on the radio on weekdays. What you are talking about is a podcast, not a radio program. If someone makes the Decred podcast. I will happily advise my listeners to go take a listen. It is a fine idea, but this implementation of it just won't work. If you wanted to talk about total sponsorship of FTL, where Decred commits for the year at the price of 30 grand per month, we can definitely talk about that.

Look, if we need to resubmit later, that is fine, we will be here. We have been on the air for 16 years and talking about crypto since 2010. 

But can you ask Ditto some things for me? 
1. Is Ditto an Ad Agency or a PR firm, or some kind of hybrid?
2. How many ad campaigns have they placed for crypto companies and what was the longest time frame that one of those schedules ran on a single venue?
3. What is their branding philosophy?  Do they believe in sticking with one media and creating a relationship with the audience or a haphazard media mix?
4. Will they be producing a radio ad themselves? Do they have a studio? What mics do they use? 
5. Will they be taking a 15% cut of the ad buy or are they going to pay a net rate. 

I don't want to sound confrontational, but I just deal with PR firms all of the time and they are great for placing interviews but they rarely have anything to do with ad buys.

IMO, this proposal, just like the previous Decredex proposal from the same user, shows a total disconnect from the project, the community, and the principles on which Decred is built upon.

1. The treasury isn't meant as a bank from which to fund your personal ventures, business ideas or experimentation. If you are to convince stakeholders to approve your proposal **you will need to demonstrate clearly how it would benefit the project** and not your business. I'm sure at some point stakeholders may be inclined to take some risks on innovative ideas that have clear potential benefits but maybe for now, it would be best to **consider stakeholders as being very conservative and careful in their spending**.

2. **Technical words have specific meanings.** If someone doesn't grasp the meanings and concepts behind those words and attempts to use them in an amalgam of tasty selling points on a checklist, it will fail miserably. The Decred community is composed of  extremely talented devs who have been in the space for years, hardcore fans who take to heart to stay informed, and stakeholders who have money at stakes, which means for them, making the best decision is paramount. If you want to bring meaningful words like ""decentralized"" to the discussion, you better make sure you understand what it means and what are the implications of these terms in the context of your proposal.

3. Being a technical community; claims of profit, market valuations/predictions, investment models, and general claims of ""future popular trends in cryptos"", will most likely be seen as vaporware and distractions. The main selling point of a proposal for building software in this project should probably **focus primarily on the direct improvement to the project** you expect, and on precisely how it will be implemented on a technical level.

4. The community will vote! If you do not engage with the community prior to posting a proposal, you do not gather ideas, and advice, you do not verify basic support and interest beforehand, you are deliberately reducing immensely your chances of seeing your proposal go through. To take a bad example: **Don't be that politician, whose name you see for the first time, on a ballot.**

5. Words are not enough to prove your capability. **The bigger the proposal, the more you will need to convince stakeholders you are capable of doing what you say.** Decred being open-source, show past contributions to this or other projects (emphasis on verifiable source-code). If you want to work with current devs, actually work with them and make sure you can get the DCC (Decred Contract clearance) and simply get along with other contractors in the project. It's sad but not everybody is cut-out for open-source and blockchain development. Ultimately, **you cannot expect stakeholders to blindly take a leap of faith** that everything will ""work out"".


As a summary, if you want to contribute, maybe taking the project as an example would be a good start. You are more likely to gain support by underselling/over-delivering. Technical accuracy is mandatory. Put forth smaller, solid blocks to build foundations within this community, rather than showing a castle of cards.","7810b868694f2e9017183bf9e975658e0e633818c566c84455c6b35ad53e7c22e527bc0832e5d693725743848d47a73f90df511843c098728f455c8540e29b05","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","2","cd6a23f00fdb9ea66daee6f4cee7418800202596dc8f1d437ed536392dc62d79cdb1505f2c639d94f077aea35c0e23f2438f417c5e2f81a1f59888259a532c04",1543987139,0,0,FALSE,NA,"85fc65cef080cfc3564906fd3d488b827d74fc99bb29143ed8aa6c400b765be9/comments/2",7,7,7,0,0

If you're just looking for a short response to this proposal, just read his comment and stop reading mine; it's long.

Seemed easiest just to quote the entire proposal with my comments inserted; here goes:
> # What
> 
> **USDD stable coin**
> 
> **The joint company - between REUM and Moentum have created a USD-backed token.**

To be clear, has this token already been created? If so, links please?

> 
> **USDD** - is a stable coin built as the currency which can be purchased with crypto (all established exchange coins) or fiat (debit card or bank transfer) by users, **REUM** seeks funding to complete the stable coin GUI, which allows users to purchase stable coins to be backed by **Decred (DCR)** as remeedable upon the USD value, each USD is pegged 1:1 to each **USDD**. 

So is REUM starting an exchange to allow the purchase of USDD, that's going to support ""all established exchange coins"" & fiat? Is the development required for that included in this proposal, or is that separate? Or is this promise contingent on [Decredex](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/e78bc28631d0e682912e3ece25944481bf978b906ea44b1ed36470c0f48b27fc) being funded?

Also, let me get this straight: USDD is backed by DCR, but pegged to USD, am I right? What happens if the USD value of the DCR backing USDD goes down; how is the peg retained? Also, who holds the DCR used for backing USDD?

> # Why
> 
> Our in-house studies has revealed stable coins as the main cryptocurrency technology for us to concentrate our efforts on in 2019 and our external online research referencing to a report, entitled the **Cryptoasset Market Coverage**.
> 
> Outlining a number of predictions for the virtual currency markets. 
>
> *The report assets that over 90 percent of “cryptoasset value will be derived from penetration of offshore deposits in the next decade” and it anticipates that such a state will propel the market capitalization of all cryptocurrency markets, according to* **Satis Crypto Market Predictions:** 
> 
> **$500 Billion** in 2019, **$1 Trillion** by 2021 and **$3.57 trillion** by 2028, while 90% of crypto currency asset value will be extracted from penetration of offshore deposits in the next ten years, stable currency is about to dominate the development conversations around digital currency over the next year.*

OK, I get it, a lot of people think stable coins are the next big thing. There are already quite a few: Tether, Dai, TrueUSD, USD Coin, Paxos, and I'm sure I missed several. How will USDD be better than these existing solutions? In other words, why yet another stable coin? What's wrong with the existing coins that USDD solves?

> All **USDD** on exchanges will be backed 1:1 with **Decred (DCR)** and valued pegged at USD, providing an obvious route to 'in-house' digitally implemented store of value provision for **DCR**, during harsh market periods and the peg will allow **Decred** to become part of the new securities market emerging within cryptocurrency. **USDD** with merge the **Decrediton GUI** for the USDD stable coin wallet solution.

Again, still haven't explained how that peg holds when DCR goes down in value.

Also, you're proposing making changes to Dcredition, which will certainly require a [Decred Contractor Clearance](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4). Has anyone from your company obtained a DCC? If so, please list those individuals.
 
> **USDD** is redeemable for USD, simply by entering your wallet address into the **USDD portal** and upload your USDD currency to get conversion back to fiat or to DCR, any verified account that passes the USDD industry standard KYC/AML check is legally entitled to redeem **USDD** for USD.

Who will be running the USDD portal and enforcing the KYC/AML standards?

> # How
> 
> **Decred** will provide **USDD** with an immediate paid up collateral model for the asset backed element of stable coins – it is a hybrid model based on a simple mathematical formula 1:1 to 1:1 pegs for value and asset.
> 
> - asset backed by **DCR**
> - value backed by USD
> 
> Every **USDD** is always fully collateralised by paid up capital as value pegged to USD and asset tethered to **Decred (DCR)* in the unique use from the standard stable to fiat coin model, our stable coin uses DCR to keep the currency true, and pegged to USD to allow simple trade calculations, profits are created by arbitrage from payments, but also from **USDD** trade, which brings further revenue while we assist as the blockchain layer of bank services.

You mentioned profits; who makes the profits? REUM or the Decred Treasury?

Still waiting to hear a clear explanation of how this peg really works.

> **Decred Politeia** funding will provide new developments related to algorithmic stability, AI/ML and KYC embedded into the smart contract and the currency directly (meaning each coin/token has a separate ID, bank friendly and regulation proof currency), also traditional market solutions for mortgages, cross border payments, remittance, escrow and clearing services.

Decred does not have turing-complete smart contracts; only simple Bitcoin-like script. How in the world are you going to do KYC with bitcoin-like script?

""regulation proof currency"" What does that even mean?

DCR already works fine for cross-border payments; and escrow is already possible with 2-of-3 multisig. Why reinvent the wheel?

> **USDD** is a secure and regulatory friendly transaction framework, which has performed R&D related to stable coins and has partnerships, trade relations as connected to institutional investors into this network to purchase or redeem **USDD.**
> 
> # Who
> 
> **USDD** is a stable coin created by **REUM Ltd** and **Spot Quote LLC** trading as **Moentum**, two companies connected by **Fabian Jean-Baptiste**, he is CEO at **REUM Ltd** based in London, UK
 
Spot Quote LLC doesn't seem to be doing very well financially; the financial report for the year 2017 indicates a **loss of $2,993 USD**. Doesn't seem like a very successful company. (Since this is an SEC-regulated company, financial reports are public; source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/vprr/1800/18007859.pdf)

> **Head of Europe for Moentum a start up with SEC Approval and Finra registration.**
> 
> **Fabian** has valuable experience and can project manage the stable coin division for USDD, with vital previous knowledge from working with Bank Token, he has ethical access to IP and to talented fintech development teams in London, **Fabian** has the respect of many blockchain companies, including Moentum who have an impressive addition to his REUM service and as part of his portfolio of related fintech services.
>
> **Bank Token** is a project manager at this project, who will provide the technology for the USDD stable coin, as pegged to Decred **DCR** with **Politeia** funding, **Fabian** will establish a office and an SME data centre (co-location) in London, UK and to house a development team and secure servers as foundational elements of the stable coin business, which will eventually boast its own fintech cloud service by Q3 2019. 

First off, this Bank Token. Bank Token has a webpage, but isn't listed on CoinMarketCap; has it launched yet? Also, the Telegram group has a total of 9 members, and is basically a ghost town (mostly posts from Fabian). Not what I'd call a success. Why will USDD not suffer the same fate?

Why do you need a location to house a development team? What's wrong with a remote team? And also, what's this fintech cloud service about?","6cb79467c822387922f9ca0e1a1424c9b6730ad771ff26956b49ef640f7bdb688a435a45c37ad49f857733af67fc901dd7018affe076d447dc14c23babf4dc0d","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","7","351a365b523f235f8e3d62866bdcf12bca22dcd790a59c5677483c3e4d893e4252654ef63584e846228cb362339f2f4f00f64779ecbb214e58ac2d0a1352fa0d",1544051220,0,0,FALSE,NA,"85fc65cef080cfc3564906fd3d488b827d74fc99bb29143ed8aa6c400b765be9/comments/7",7,7,7,0,0

> **USDD** will be launching in Q2 2019, subject to **Politeia** funding 

_Way_ too short timeframe IMO, given all you're promising.
 
> **USDD** will undergo a third-party evaluation from the Decred community and will release the USDD information, as we develop the project, utilising **Politeia** and communicating our plans via **Decred (Stat X and Telegram) social media accounts** to ensure best practices and to stay in tune with the **Decred** ethos. 

Decred community is a broad group; can you be more specific? Also, Telegram is not bridged to the main Matrix/Slack/Discord chat; so that's not the preferred communication platform.

> # How Much
> 
> **USDD** stable coin release formally request an terms of agreement budget of **$394,000 per annum**, over four year period:
> 
> -  for institutional membership fees 
> 
> *$36,000 per annum* 

What institutions specifically?

> -  to claim office space in the City of London 
> 
> *$28,000 per annum*

As mentioned before, I question if this is really needed.
 
> -  to pay for enterprise assistance from (Wells Fargo, Nasdaq and Bitgo) 
> 
> *$180,000 per annum*

You have an exact figure here; does that mean you've already negotiated with them? Can I contact them to confirm you've spoken with them regarding this?
 
> -  for international business travel to negotiate with Banks, Fintech groups and development teams 
> 
> *$20,000 per annum*

It's 2018; video conferencing is a thing; is all that travel really needed?

> -  to develop office to allow international communication, teleconference kits, SaaS, also to implement a blockchain oriented voice solution, thus cutting our travel costs
> 
>  *$8,000 per annum*

Why do you need a special blockchain oriented voice solution? What's wrong with existing generic solutions?

> -  to bring external development work in-house into our newly created office, also to allow us to integration and staff hires to upgrade our current offices to support the stable coin business, also to onboard additional sales staff year on year as the stable coin market grows 
> 
> *$20,000 per annum* per staff member, over 4 year period

So is there one office, or multiple offices? How many staff members do you anticipate? Also, $20k is on the low end for developers, I'm suspicious of the quality of work you'll get for that rate.

> -  to purchase an electric vehicle as a USDD stable coin branded vehicle, providing constant advertising as parked in the city of London, also used as the HQ vehicle, parking outside of conferences and blockchain events across the UK and Europe for fintech conferences for consistent UK national and European (Euro Tunnel/Le Shuttle) based travel.
> 
> *$35,000 per annum* 

Are you buying a new electric vehicle every year or what? How in the world do you come up with the ridiculous price of $35,000 per annum? Maintenance costs can't be anywhere near that high. Or are you buying a brand-new Tesla with a payment plan? Also, who gets the car at the end of the 4 years?

> -  to hire PR and marketing teams for communication with national financial markets here in the UK 
> 
> *$42,000 per annum*
>
> REUM will use this primary start up capital to create and then establish the crypto stable coins on exchanges 
> 
> Listing fees for one exchange per year, over 4 year period
> 
> *$25,000 per annum*

Historically, Decred has not paid exchange listing fees; I see no reason why we'd change that now.

It seems you are trying to **take advantage** of DCR's Development fund, especially by asking for $750. 

These types of simple tutorials are generally done by Youtube content creators **for free** (as you did with the 66 other projects) though they get paid by ads, donations, and affilliate marketing so their work is not really for free. I don't see why Decred stakeholders should finance something like this.

As Decred grows in popularity we will _undoubtedly_ see content creators make tutorials covering all aspects of Decred.

Stakeholders should only finance such videos if they are high in production value, something like this:

I don’t see much proposals approved and rejected on Politeia, especially from marketers, and I’m hopeful that I can add value to the network with my proposal and potentially inspire many others to do the same with their own ideas.

$750 not fair for 3 videos? I’d like to challenge that seeing how this price was determined and adjusted by Decred stakeholders and the support team. A majority of the responses so far have said this price is reasonable. 

I’ve researched the free videos for Decred Tutorials on YouTube. The videos I’m creating were chosen by determining what’s NOT already done along with seeing what I can do better. From my perspective, my detailed walk through videos are much more user-friendly, especially for novice users. These videos will be valuable because a) I will complete a FULL SET of tutorials which will cover the most important topics chosen by the community, b) I will walk people step by step as if they are looking over my shoulder, c) I will help people AVOID specific mistakes they can make in the process like not using a password manager which tends to be overlooked and undiscussed, and d) I will make fresh content for Decred made in 2019. I find it highly relevant to make updated videos since user interfaces change regularly. 

I agree that content creators will undoubtedly make more tutorials covering all different aspects of Decred and many will do them for free. However, since Politeia is big part of Decred, I suspect that these same content creators will pick up on the fact that they can actually get funded to do these videos and will prefer to take the Politeia approach as I am doing. I did the free videos to show my skills and seriousness. The additional videos I’m proposing to do is difficult for me to justify doing for free. I hope that’s understandable. Plus, I am proposing to do these 3 videos in under 1 month versus the unpredictable time it will take for someone else to make free videos on similar subjects which may or may not be as complete as mine. 

Also, I like the video you shared. I’d like to challenge your notion about this type of production being the ONLY type of videos stakeholders finance. My suggestion for stakeholders is to fund all types of video production including documentaries, promo/ informative/ intro videos like the one you referenced, detailed walk throughs like mine, daily or weekly video blogs, interviews, presentations online and in-person, and etc. and not be limited to one style.

To be clear... Yes, I will walk-through how to create a Politeia proposal since it's very easy to do. However, my intention is to go much deeper than that. 

The recent updates for Video #3 state that I will: ""Explain to users step by step how to make a proposal starting with the guidelines for putting together a proposal, discussing it on Slack, posting it on Reddit, editing proposal based off feedback, finalizing proposal and submitting it, and getting community support."" 

Let me know if you think that’s appropriate or not to include in Video #3 or if you think it deserves a separate video. Since Politeia is about proposals in general, I feel like it is appropriate to include in Video #3 because the video will appear too basic without it. 

Because low quality proposals get submitted, my intention for Video #3 is to teach people how to make high-quality proposals in general (not just how to submit one) and create a basic standard on what’s expected. Therefore, Politeia will attract more high-quality proposals along with users who know how to use the entire Politeia user-interface. 

And No, Cryptocurrency.Market will not be mentioned in the videos.","bb6e003da4b1b196f758bd2a826728032d7fa9797aba4ce51ee50e9d116ce763dbdb097787e236af1b0e741cf0ab8f640ef79b28f2e2a188f59387fb863a3a04","cd71155ab0f7944118e8a9ed46bdde77d4724f61f2c9ebffaf898308f0185b92","13","3b356ced1618b335f624d4497e17502629659dc52316ef079a39d57fbedb7029eb1eef802710d337f542ee0b42eb88d0ff3a538d1cfab7eddd6c9cbe0644ab01",1550795569,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f/comments/13",2,2,2,0,0

* Ownership transfer of content to Decred.
* Fair budget.
* One revision per video.
* How the author handled criticism and incorporated feedback over multiple iterations.

Concerns:

* Complete beginners may be not the best target for Decred
* The requested budget is low and nice, but I think the cost of collective attention spent on deciding such a small expense is way above the expense. I guess it's okay now because Marketing 2019 is still not approved, so no certainty about its budget. In the future, I think it would be reasonable to include small things into a bigger budget.

Questions:

* Will these tutorials educate people to stop using insecure OS (Windows, Android) or bad habits of keeping funds on exchanges?
* Linked [Decrediton tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rWLI_pC0d4) doesn't include a critical step to ""avoid getting hacked by bad actors"", which is to verify signatures. This is the only way to make sure you get the software unaltered, do you plan to cover it?

Regarding your first question, ""Will these tutorials educate people to stop using insecure OS (Windows, Android)?"" - I will be using my Mac Desktop while screen sharing and recording. Can you elaborate on what you mean by this specifically and why?

Regarding, ""bad habits of keeping funds on exchanges?"" & ""Verifying signatures"" - I will definitely cover both in the tutorials.

The unfortunate reality is that computer security and privacy is a rabbit hole.

On the highest level you develop good habits of attention, discipline and hygiene. You learn to find the right domain, check secure connection, verify sigs, backup seeds and not leave funds on exchange. Also useful are habits to not install random software on the device that stores your keys and generally minimize the amount of code it executes.

Depending on the amount of money in question, at some point it makes sense to also consider an operating system you use. Windows devolved into total anti-privacy garbage in recent editions. OSX looks slightly better, but after multiple incidents like [empty root password](https://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/7g738d/anyone_can_login_as_root_with_empty_password/) oopsie or the [FaceTime](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/28/facetime-bug-hear-audio/) oopsie, Apple stuff looks questionable. The rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper, down to the Intel spy chips conveniently installed in majority of modern laptops, and finally to horrible architectural CPU bugs present since 90's.

At some point we might have generic [security guides](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/101) that could be useful outside Decred.

I see that your tutorials are targeted at people at the very beginning of the rabbit hole, and helping them to develop even couple good habits would help them avoid most silly losses and be of huge value to the crypto space.","a498060679ac0e9a8ebdff4d057bf620760781047e72d6361165d70ce3e0134e1e2dd489fb0bec620a40fc48bd84b2f2fe5c6e5c49c5832adc0ecaf019c2c307","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","32","6c3da7eaabdde2be7ff5ab7561bc1da9076baf8e07b20eff9edde6dda2b9fe8d3c095b3b54a364c2801c35252242d1ee7b05583d1d075fde496ef5a3cb53d00d",1551365239,0,0,FALSE,NA,"a3def199af812b796887f4eae22e11e45f112b50c2e17252c60ed190933ec14f/comments/32",1,1,1,0,1

Re 4th video, if you see good response for first 3 videos, consider drawing from Marketing 2019 budget (if it's approved). I'm sure it can handle these amounts, will be faster and more flexible for everyone, and won't bother stakeholders with another tiny expense. My opinion is that it is better to group small items into big ones. It's up to you eventually.

- People that want to buy Decred who need an easier onramp (e.g. someone introduced to Decred at a meetup who isn't that sophisticated).
- People that want to buy with a little more privacy (obviously this is determined by the selected ATM vendor's KYC policies).
- People that buy DCR simply because it pops up on the screen when they're buying BTC.

-General Bytes is a second-tier BTM manufacturer. Genesis Coin is the clear market leader and most professoinal company. We do not want to integrate only with General Bytes.

-99.9% of BTM volume is BTC... there is hardly any volume in LTC, ZEC, XRP or ETH --> no one is going to buy DCR through an Bitcoin ATM.

-BTM operators are not necessarily going to list DCR on their BTMs when it is unclear whether or not it is a security.

Crypto ATM integration should not be paid by the treasury money. 

It doesn't work that way.

If the premium charged by the ATM when people buys DCR from it cannot even cover the integration cost, what's the point of integrating it to an ATM anyway.

Because bitcoin is bitcoin, DCR is DCR.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and its brand awareness determined that the ATM integrator was going to ""hug its legs,"" not the other way around.
However, in the eyes of many ordinary people, DCR is still a counterfeit currency. We should rationally face this reality.As long as the cost is controllable, we should actively try these channels.

There are barely any in countries that are cash heavy and only 3 in whole of Africa, where people have actually shown inclination towards an quick fiat exchange with no other options.

Now that we have been listed on Vertbase and they are looking to expand in EU, i see very little to gain from getting onto the ATMs which are obviously less convenient option and probably a high risk one due to need of physical presence. Also if they do get any usage (which i am skecptical about) then it will just divert away the liquidity from Vertbase. I think if we can rather show enough volume on Vertbase, that is visible/reported at least as opposed ATM volume which as issac says was not available/reported, then we can make a good case for listing on other exchanges.

Apart from that many people have talked about, (anecdotal evidence from bitcoin) high fees/margins/spreads, privacy infringement via camera and non-working/missing ATMs while being shown on the map, as problems.

I think there is very little to gain from getting listed on ATMs especially at a price point of $10-20K.

I can promise you that building out DCR integration for General Bytes machines is a waste of time.

In addition to the reasons listed in my previous comment, here are several additional key points that voters need to consider:

1) **We are seeing ZERO demand from users of Bitcoin ATMs to purchase Decred. No need to provide something to users when they're not asking for it.**

2) **BTM operators will not list DCR on their GB machines because they don't want to hold inventory. Each operator only has a certain amount of USD-denominated capital to be used as ""float"". They don't want to take any capital away from the BTC float in order to purchase DCR, a coin that is very illiquid and that they do not know anything about.**

3) **Operators are cautious to list coins that have risk of being a security. **While it is believed that DCR will not be a security, the only large-cap coins that we can confidently conclude at not securities are BTC and ETH, and maybe LTC and BCH.

4) The vast majority of General Bytes machines are one-way ""buy only machines"" -- hence operators would need to purchase DCR in order to sell it to users of their GB machines. **Most Bitcoin ATM operators do not have access to DCR markets because there are hardly any DCR/USD pairs.**

**If you want this to pass... NEXT STEPS:**
-Reach out to 1) Genesis Coin and 2) some major US-based BTM operators, such as CoinMe/CoinStar, RockitCoin, CoinSource, PayDepot, etc. --- If Genesis Coin is also on board AND you have the majority of the top 10 BTM operators willing to purchase DCR inventory in order to sell it on their BTMs, then this proposal becomes a little more compelling.

To be clear, _as it stands_, for the benefit of the DCR community, I will be voting ""No"" on this proposal.","ef412d79853aedc6170be623aff91786668d82111e4d3c1dcd29ca3943d84e4d4ac5b0cd4cd88f01a09ab501bb775402411f53e29212bbc89e1bce00617b3f05","d94e4e3478a69860eb90f27576cc51233e8cf04b590dd3d992e5961672694aec","28","980b5aa07d6873131b6db471cf44a3ae61421f04a191cea1e4bce79fcf142c250d8a5e5a9b37baaf33455f4615e99c6d4af82b316ac2f14f511948ebeb696d0f",1551383432,0,0,FALSE,NA,"aea224a561cfed183f514a9ac700d68ba8a6c71dfbee71208fb9bff5fffab51d/comments/28",1,1,1,0,0

From the proposal I understand, that generally at Bcash a Coin interested has to pay commission to be listed on your ATMs and that Decred will only be added to a limited amount of ATMs. E.g. those currently existing and deployed in the near future, but not on further ones. 

Hence, with this proposal, Decred would:

1. Pay for the implementation
2. Keep paying for maintenance 
3. Pay for being listed on future additional ATMs
4. But not receive a cut of the ATMs earnings

It sounds like Decred will pay for a part of your business without receiving a share.

It was several years ago, before Bcash's time, so it's possible the following assumption may not apply to Bcash ATMs, but my experience with a different crypto ATM is:

The coins are significantly marked up to begin with, then the ATM takes a trading fee. Couple that with charging the actual coin community a premium for being available on the ATM, and it sounds to me like the ATM owners are trying to dip their feet into as many revenue streams as possible. (Not a bad business plan, but something I don't think serves any benefit to Decred).

I would be curious to hear specific numbers on the markup, fees, specific monthly users, and monthly maintenance costs involved with having DCR available on these ATMs. I know Bcash has no obligation to share this information, but it would help me make a final decision either way.

For DCR, I feel that the only appeal of this proposal is the marketing aspect.

Of course we make a profit from ATMs usage but the expenses are much higher than you think. Our proposal includes a customer & tech support regarding DCR. Also another NODE for ATMs is not so easy to support (technically speaking), if fact it is an addition to our network that needs extra resources from our servers & continuous monitoring etc. DCR is not famous in Europe so we need to advertise it by our marketing department (social media staff, salesmen, ATM operators, online advertising, SEO campaigns, media coverage in general). The fact that DCR doesn't yet have any reliable mobile wallet also doesn't make things easier (our clients usually use Jaxx, Blockchain, Coinomi with ATMs). We won't be able to generate enough profit from DCR during the first year in order to cover our expenses.

Maybe there would be some benefit in additional **Decred** exposure and the ability to convert cash to/from **Decred** in a few places.

The following is a summary of the responses received so far:

**GeneralBytes**
* Machines: ~2000
* Fees: $0
* Marketing Requirement: None
* Deployment Type: Push
* Developer Responsibility: Decred
* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  GeneralBytes would ""backport"" the wallet to existing machines.

**Lamassu**
* Machines: ~1000
* Fees: $0
* Marketing Requirement: None
* Deployment Type: Pull
* Development Responsibility: Decred
* Process Provided: Decred would be responsible for development of the wallet installation by forking/modifying the open-source repository.  Decred would also be responsible for contacting ATM owners to suggest pulling the updated software or purchasing our own ATMs to release with the Decred software.

**CoinFlip**
* Machines: ~200
* Fees: $10000
* Marketing Requirement: 3 months of cross posting
* Deployment Type: Push
* Development Responsibility: CoinFlip
* Proess Provided: Decred would pay the $10000 fee to cover development and deployment.  CoinFlip would develop and push the wallet to existing machines.  Both parties would agree to run 3 months of social media promotion.

I have additional requests for information pending.  My recommendation is that we get more information as a community and take a pragmatic approach to ROI and market penetration.  Note that this information is based on initial emails with marketing managers and verification would be needed before an RFP or new proposal submission.  Based on limited information so far GeneralBytes is a strong ATM contender.  Any community experience with GB or other ATM providers?

Dimitrios and Giannis, I appreciate your effort making the first proposal to the Decred Community and sparking interest in ATMs.  I personally hope you come back with a more competitive proposal as we look for the right solution.","02938edaff5e719aec2fdc920ac23e15a3a75954c12b5f25194de4e7f89db3837089231a69ae350bf3dd615546cab2a9ab71daa4c47bb36b1532a9cc7c04fe0f","6336046c6f360e4a86f360e7802a5939642f2a4b668fdc01bfeef6040608f43b","22","8cb2302fb8bbb16f7b7162091461c11daa89a03b21d7a29c44231f69e840cc1d03fdfa17eea4359724fdb625c875d2b33897eec89540d6cdaf40f6aa5e00a70e",1543696087,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/22",13,13,13,0,1

My understanding is that Decred is open source and that Crypto ATMs charge fees for transactions which go to the proprietor. So if i'm understanding things correctly there should be a minimal internal cost for the ATM proprietor to implement the open source Decred wallet into their ATM infrastructure and then profit from the fees their clients pay when using the ATM. 

Help me to understand why the cost of this should fall on anyone other than the ATM manufacturer.","0174f3ba620fb05851a0b7c01a361e2b36835718b91143226d213deed68b8d1174a2d2fb8d6b17155634500c6b2b470df36e7cf18f3ca72384882ffcba6f280f","8c2b431683ac7d505569d0fffdebda44654a09848b2f035ded81381df812971a","23","351a0048dbc49b724cef3e5576c9d42b214e2c2239928691d1b3dcf2f2810e8020ed43714a9c871664c737a5abd07f3dc7e46e6412de352ad31edb79a12d3f07",1543725059,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bb7e19283d5c65fed598d5a2f4afcc2b5d2eab187b9cb84fc4304430f80b5ad1/comments/23",1,1,1,0,0

My worry is that a firm with experience dealing with other cryptocurrencies in the space will find that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase. We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver. 

> As part of the company’s narrative, Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

I'd like to know Jake's thoughts on this. In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake. I greatly trust and respect him, and I expect he will have significant influence in the project for the foreseeable future, but we're not here to make a cult of personality around him.

Overall, this looks like a great pitch for promoting a company, but Decred is not a company. It's a decentralized cryptocurrency.

Also, from the diverse list of clients, it seems to indicate that Wachsman will promote nearly any project that has funding available. I totally understand why a marketing company would do that from a revenue perspective. However, I wonder if it wouldn't be more effective to have marketing people who actually are sold on DCR themselves; they HODL DCR, they stake DCR, they're perhaps even active here on Politeia. In other words, take DCR community members who have marketing experience, and pay them to market DCR more effectively.

If we would go ahead with Wachsman, I would prefer a shorter trial period before committing to six months. Or is the current proposal cancelable at any time?

Decred is not a company. The executive team = stakeholders. During development and this transition, the executive contractor is Company 0.

Overall, I'm a bit pessimistic about this proposal. $120,000 for six months seems too expensive. I don't think six months is enough time to develop a good marketing strategy built for the long term. If we decide to try them out, I would go with a trial phase and reduced budget. I'm looking forward to more comments and thoughts for other stakeholders.

I think Jake is a great ambassador for Decred. I have also seen JZ and Marco do great interviews. I am comfortable expanding the number of Decred personalities to include all three and so that we can deliver a consistent message.  

We have lots of very smart people in Decred, and several could/should be projected as thought leaders in the crypto space. One reason why I happen to like Decred is because we have more than one heavyweight personalities with strengths in certain areas. 

The only issue that gave me pause on the proposal is the extensive list of crypto clients. Yes it's great they know crypto well. But clients include Dash and Horizen, which I might regard as competitors (even if I own some of the tokens on their client list). Would there be a conflict of interest? Probably not, but I want to raise the issue in case others can eliminate my doubts entirely or surface other concerns around that. 

The cost of the proposal, given the international reach and apparent connections to media and event organizers, seems reasonable (and yes, I have worked with brand and marketing agencies in different areas of the globe). If we can negotiate further, I am all for that --- but let's give marketing some serious attention. 

I recognize that we wouldn't be here discussing this if it was not for the outstanding work of our developers and programmers. But well placed marketing is also important - and we must have presence with both retail crypto investors and institutional investors - globally.

I would encourage others to also be skeptical of a marketing proposal offered by a marketing company (sorry Wachsman, but I know how marketing is). I do agree with the others who have suggested that Decred should have more general marketing services, but this proposal just comes off to me as an expensive ""brand in a box"" subscription service.

A lot of the services offered are ones I doubt will even get used, and I don't think we need much assistance when it comes to event strategies - our current event group seems to be doing just fine.

I don't think we need to pay for positive media.

While I am hoping for few marketing proposals in general and many productive proposals like development and research, we should not completely dismiss marketing.

Caution must be taken though not to make decred appear like a corporate for profit entity that spends a lot on marketing and tries to attract investors.  
That would not resonate well within the cryptocurrency community, but from the proposal it looks like the provider is well aware of the core values of decred. 

The current branding (logo, stakey, graphics are very very good, clean and nicely designed and I would not change the branding at all. 

If we have one very professional provider who is able to add significant value to decred, then I would support having one provider with a clear plan and structure as opposed to countless scattered marketing proposals.

I was one DCR team members listening in on the presentation call. My impression with Wachsmans brief presentation was positive, as they focused on quite real practicalities and describing a methodical way of doing things (on PR and Events fronts) rather than attempting to sell the project based on past clients rep. or vague promises. 

As a designer, i'm very considerate about the optics and how different actions effect the reputation of the project. I'm largely in favour of the proposal, as it's mostly sound and proportionate in the ways it relates to these matters. 

Afaik there is not a conflict of interest with their other crypto clients, as there's different employees assigned to these projects, nevertheless this needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts. 

In response to some comments preferring only the current ""grass-roots"" approach and fears around giving off so called ""corporate vibe"" – these cases should not be looked at in a black and white manner. Decred needs a solid PR & events output and professional presence just as much as it needs the friendly enthusiasts and community hotheads. One does not have to conflict the other. I would imagine worse future outcomes if DCR happens to lack on the professional front – as then it simply may not be taken seriously and get the foot through the door when needed. One must not forget, this is a financial product after all. 

To give an illustrated example, quoting one of my past critiques around overusing and turning the spaceman jacket into a bad gimmick if presented wrong context: 
“I am an investor or a person working at relevant business/institution visiting a conference with aim to connect with xyz crypto projects – see a number of professional and respectable looking talkers. Last talk is Decred. I don’t know what Decred is yet. See someone looking like a clown come to the stage. Red flag hits, leave before it starts as the first impression is ruined and i’ve got better things to do.” First impression one won’t get to re-do. 

There are certain marketing and PR approaches that are fundamentally incompatible with DCR imo, for example: deeply sales oriented and high-pressure sales tactics; ""fishsalesmen type"" hype/spam campaigns relying on overpromising, dumbing down; dishonest, misleading or very clickbaity communications for content or campaign advertising, all kind of referral/multi-level marketing schemes. I don't think any of these are present here.

**Media Training + Speaker positioning** 

This service should certainly be focused on. Correct me if i'm wrong, but in the long term DCR will need many topnotch spokespersons rather than relying primarily on Jake and Marco, as neither wish to build images of a central figures. Ideally this service can be leveraged to help train existing community members up, to be better enquipped for the role. Meaning DCR will in the long run have many adept spokespersons. Giving presentations and interviews is simply another skill that can always be improved through work and training. I find it negligible if situation occurs where people who are untrained or with little to no experience end up giving presentations, interviews etc about the project.

**Key Messaging and Brand Narrative Development + Content Creation**

This is the only item I have some concerns about. There are three people listed in the team with mostly directional roles, however none with a dedicated focus on creative copywriting or a creative strategy work. (These are marked as secondary roles.)

Working out key messaging + a communications strategy and documenting it in a reasonable way has been an item that I've discussed with 2 or 3 no longer present marketing contributors, of who none successfully delivered any useful results. So this should not be taken lightly. 

Although DCR has a number of excellent in-house writers, I would say we've always been missing the creative copywriting types. The issue here is that documentation writing, research writings, journalism writings and creative copywriting are all very different animals. A lot of the comms. output so far has been written by a group. Comparing it objectively to brands who have it created by dedicated professionals – these will never be on the same level.

When it comes to creative copywriting, communication strategy creation and such – to get something actually useful worked out in DCR's context, this task absolutely needs at least one specialized senior level copywriter (or creative director, strategist whatever the title w/ similar background) with a strong, demonstrable track-record (e.g. case studies). Reason being that the scope itself is already way too big for a non-dedicated or directional roles to cover: building an deep understanding, creating objectives and devising strategies to accomplish them, concepting work, creative problem solving, imaginativness and eye for detail, going in-depth with calibrating the voice and articulations, having an understanding of various aspects of branding, awarness and ability to tell difference between short lived trends and timeless techniques, strong judgement and projection skills on outcomes, ability to sync with the design direction, etc… You get my point.

Also in case there's plan of using shadow-writers to assist the key personnel – this has been tried and did not work well. I'm in favour of the actual people doing the work being behind the table and accountable.

This essentially will work as a tool and a standard for everyone who wants to communicate about Decred – meaning that tangible deliverables and well accessible documentation of the work are of importance here. For one potential benchmark, I would suggest to take a look at the project https://brand.estonia.ee/story/core-messages/ where quite reasonable communication guidelines were developed for a large (and obviously even harder to define) entity – this being a country, but it's end use case is similar to DCR as it's meant for very different businesses and individuals.

Obviously one of the most difficult parts of the project will be getting the ultimate agreement on what goes. I'm well aware that having too many cooks in the kitchen will mess up the work and I obviously don't recommend this. Preferably the concept development process could include a small number of expert contributors covering the key disciplines of the projects. Only once a rough consensus on a solution is agreed, this can be brought out for larger reviewing. Also type of involvement, tasks and responsibilities for each participant should be well defined from the start to. 

To wrap things up, my questions are: 
- Can you elaborate on this item, your process and the deliverables output for this work? 
- Do you plan on involving more talent to cover this front? 

Thanks.","ed11f934b4e1583f599e0293cc52b9c3a69035c55c2c8a58ef6c2b1c35d6c98d1b4b47a99a4d90c7c1a8fb5090d6aa90210bf8fb4e588db3597b72a989f95508","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","18","25479acadcb07901f0e2bf6e31e3dad347a655c357037fae9e84c102431798f24d0d56a49b37b3e075fafccec228f74b3ab83fe402edec81cb2da98fd0a9e704",1540223542,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/18",-1,7,3,4,0

Agree wholeheartedly here. The fact that Decred is a horse of a different wheelbase isn’t just a major draw for us — it’s a notion that we anticipate will be exceptionally (and justifiably) well-received by the media as well. This is especially true for the more “mainstream” reporters, many of whom will honestly just hang up the phone if they hear “ICO” or “Token Sale.” 

> We don't do hype, we build. We under-promise, over-deliver.

Very, very good call here. This would absolutely be our recommendation as well. 

Wachsman’s goal is never to merely promote hype around a project, it is to demonstrate to the wider blockchain, cryptocurrency, and mainstream communities the inherent value propositions of our clients in a non-hyperbolic way. Wachsman endeavors to act as a megaphone through which Decred’s message can be heard by a greater audience, bringing those with whom this message resonates with into the community. 

>  In interests of decentralization, we don't want centralization around Jake.
 
While we completely understand the importance of maintaining decentralization, from a media (and events) standpoint we feel that it is exceptionally important for there to be at least one — but likely more depending on the communications vertical — advocate/ambassador that is available and media trained to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors (it is my understanding that we will be doing media training for 6+ individuals, but are more than happy to offer it to more people, as needed). 

This is exceptionally important when it comes to communication verticals like thought leadership/ expert commentary. Wachsman has mainstream reporters reaching out to us daily for quick commentary, and the ability to have an established representative from Decred readily available to turn around initial thoughts on breaking news is hugely beneficial for securing coverage. We anticipate that during our engagement we will work closely with the Decred community as a whole, but in the interest of keeping Decred on people’s radar outside of major announcements, suggest a strong media presence for select team members at least in the immediate future.","4418dfa696e3b15a14ac1d9a2a5833fdf27f3111ee65e09adaa2da25a1adccac25b588e25635eb1193337a9520b6a1bf0443973784d23b8b7996fc9ae7b96408","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","20","a9aa2336fadcca1cc62a61f0a0d151d3ff04a3f68e07cc72827a5b73bfed2ac866ed7ad0d9c8927b0ec70781b52da0f784d476fc4f9464679feb8ecc00a9b90a",1540232829,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/20",2,2,2,0,0

Wachsman are true admirers of the community Decred has built as well as the values on which it was built upon, and we would never tarnish these values by offering Decred a “brand in a box” proposal. What we endeavor to do is to magnify the achievements already made by the Decred community, and the achievements which Decred will undoubtedly make in the future by communiticating them to the world in the correct manner, a manner which is in line with these founding values and the long term goals and ambitions of Decred.

> With the work that goes on to make Decred what it is, independent media outlets will continue to keep up with the project and our exposure will grow along side the project.

This is certainly true to an extent, and congratulations are definitely in order given the project’s success to date. It is our firm belief, however, that given the amazing growth of the project so far - and all the significant milestones to come - Decred deserves a robust expansion of media coverage. What Decred is doing is truly exceptional and you have all worked hard to get here — ** everyone ** should know about it!

Furthermore, it is worth stressing the value of a strategic approach to media, as opposed to one that is merely reactive and ad hoc. There is immense value in controlling your narrative and having news come from you — not just being about you and out of your control. Wachsman has spent years developing unmatched relationships with media (both in trade and mainstream) and as such is uniquely suited to navigate the media landscape, knowing when and which reporters to offer select pitches and announcements to — ultimately striving to have more control over when and what things are said about Decred and how the project is positioned by the media.","e70bd21e5994c60cb67cd472796209d2d78a8f636038e60656ce4388b41c0b706527845e1d84d6670efd1610fa91d50a09b3e32bc5bf9fe5bd3f77ca25e5f302","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","21","af4ea34f93286db0b83c2cb376535a52a51f24955fbc6e2bab68b13d14a112041e77ce00d51fcfcda677911a609d61002ec7f7c9c577d3978b345ab019ba050c",1540233005,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/21",3,3,3,0,0

The vetting group had different opinions on which group was best for Decred, but the consensus was that both cleared the bar and would be good partners.","c886a9fdb6a87051e2db37888ee5d1d68f89dd1e3a771f01e745da32e0d1e84a8e41408521d5a0832585f32b955890537366d25b8799f4fbf2fb2f50ebce4e02","2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","35","3a56d32ca2093e59ce5285b9aa87da5c2103d11719880643da88c58921896f53a62bf78dc85706a284902b82c0a50d6a13bdea272e28d3560f74689d5b180201",1540257593,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/35",3,3,3,0,0

I see two competing proposals for PR services, and I believe that both firms would bring better visibility to Decred. I have however one major concern after reading comments here and on slack so I will be posting this exact message/question to both contenders:

The Decred devs and team members are doing an enormous job at the moment with all the work being done; balancing their precious time between coding, testing, speaking about Decred, writing material, answering questions, attending events and being active on various platforms.

How would your firm specifically help or provide assistance, so that the team can remain efficient in those tasks while increasing visibility? Or in other words, how will you make sure that new PR activities related to your proposal are optimized for results and do not become a burden on development and on other fields of the project ?","985754f7e1a594a7dfba3b343db83d444e383da37a55188ac3f9179c05a298c715852151833f6b44e84402e5439d752a7c9425f9ecb7ffdd79e30978c68cd20e","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","36","9ac2e50e76dc6fefb20a6c5117d45dd40ac47ed4f4b11426901ce7cad02a35f0df1b0ec2bfa8785e22e8b3646b83457d4dde21ffd459749a2ef5a835edbe9208",1540262097,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/36",2,2,2,0,0

Hear me out on this one. I've attended the DASH conference and saw how Wachsman PR worked for them. DASH paid not only for PR but for a full rebrand into a more commercial product. As a result, the core team decided to be more hands off and assumed that PR is ""covered"". Dash core stopped answering questions about DASH development and started becoming more distant and corporate. All communication with the core team was ""filtered"" via and it felt very distant. 

Ironically this alienated a huge portion of the DASH community and hindered the development work.

One of the things I’ve noticed when companies meet with us is they say, “You know, our last PR firm had good ideas but it just translated to more work for us. And we don’t have time to do all that.” We pride ourselves in making sure Ditto does all the heavy lifting. Doesn’t mean we won’t need some of your valuable time. But it’s also why we are considered the “anti PR Agency.” We do things the right way, which isn’t how other PR firms do it.

A good PR plan actually takes time OFF your schedule. If we create a smart plan, prioritize, etc., Ditto can then execute without having to bother you too much. I’d argue a good PR plan maximizes the time you have – not add on more time. And it’s why we don’t charge by the hour, like most PR firms. We’d much rather get BIG results in less time than the opposite of that.

Backing up a little more, we work with developers ranging from coding bootcamps to founders to blockchain companies. So, we understand how to work with devs. Also, we are a new source for your community. A dev may have a question about something PR related, and Ditto is 24/7 on demand to answer any and everything.

Finally, Ditto has succeeded and grown over the years based on one simple reason: we are results focused. It’s right in our little motto: Strategy, execution, results.","6edd8a0c3242a9fac9120b8bf20c7e19165fa08144133a6eb304f2460dd95f85b4cf0da822293d134a34d2abdbce7feb3417432b4a455b574f97159de7794104","9f0a8ad970275393d70d9bca8b33847c1747f9a276a0fca5b88ef51767af25fc","40","c6e6b36139a685ed3982aad56bc67f28b328fe3afbd3da8790c3faae321c375d6da6ff795c21cd0b0e7cd53f0f1364f1de5b159e2eecd0a42300eefbfabefc0e",1540322888,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/40",-1,5,2,3,0

However, my concerns around brand comms strategy work remain. Can you provide any case studies that are relevant specifically in this area of operations and to the described deliverables, rather than journalism related items? I see the two being quite different animals after all. Basically i’m interested in seeing is the sheer creative and intellectual output in a brands own environment, where the tangible work can speak for itself. And this of the suggested copywriter(s)/strategists involved. 

Asking this as I didn’t come across any on your mainsite and only found some external reports that are covering mostly statistics and reach or journalism examples. 

Considering all the work is completely remote, I think there will be a lot of playing-the-phone that will make it difficult to be synced up and most productive. I do consider the copywriter(s) on the task largely responsible for the creative output and assume it would be preferred from Decred team’s end to have them involved closely.","fd427d73622541b5c3dd7ef402455aa53a6926441fabdf314f6b1bc285a5d06bb389e3d2ad25be6dac4042a01fbb805ed58ee5a9a61c88ff532a4ae0d4f6c001","23fe3a8aae4b6234a2bc15b2dbe9973e13287ed0849fbd5e3fd743709c737b73","41","e7158429702117f6f3a2f10a8565544fdca502dc65a93697311c62708b211c24793f3f1905440cde436eb019c27040af7624c409c6974a08e121d994abc01c04",1540327238,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/41",0,4,2,2,0

We have seen time and time again with the company’s coming to us from other firms that it’s the only way you can service blockchain projects. Decred’s representatives, community, and developers are working tirelessly to do all the work you mentioned and more. None of this succeeds if we have to give you more work because we don’t have a big enough or experienced enough or committed enough team in place to service Decred. 
Take our events support for instance — the main reason that we began offering it to clients is because we saw many dedicating a ton of time to navigating the 700 plus crypto events (not to mention hundreds of events we can support you with in other verticals, like mainstream finance or tech) that come into their inboxes a year. With Wachsman, Decred’s representatives and community essentially won’t have to worry about anything related to events coordination other than booking flights and hotels. Speaker pitches, negotiating pricing with organizers, booth set up, even SWAG coordination — we’re taking it off your plate.
The very first thing that Wachsman would do when Decred comes on is have a full kickoff call with the community-chosen representatives of the project (on a conference call that you’re all more than welcome to listen in on). This kickoff call (frankly it’s a brain dump) lets our team get extremely well versed in the project, its timeline, its needs, hopes for positioning in the media, and more. We learn your project inside and out so that we can bring it to reporters and events organizers without needing to go back and forth to your team, slowing down the process and making more work for you.

While you're right in that I cannot list specific KPI's (i.e ""we'll get Decred in Forbes this week""), I can point to our proven track record of lasting and impactful success (both over the course of full campaigns and recently -- its a lot harder to get coverage now than it was six months ago, and we are still getting amazing results every day) as an indicator of what your investment might translate to in terms of output.

Who will run these events and pay for them?

Generally, is there any funding that may be required from Decred on top of this proposal's budget? If so, do you have an estimate?

> Wachsman will position Jake Yocom-Piatt as the primary spokesperson and media point of contact.

If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

Interesting, I'd love to understand this better. Say we have an incident, like a 12 hour network stall, or a serious vulnerability discovered. What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples? Looking at your connections, do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery? Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability. Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal? Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing? Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts? Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work? Will you publish post-event analyses publicly? List of clients in the portfolio is impressive but only contains short descriptions of clients. Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? Like a simple per-client list of actions taken, with some result analysis. linnutee asked a similar question with no reply so far. How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing? Why some of the linked articles feature Blockfolio and Ethereum while they are not in the list of clients? Also I'm puzzled by the ones featuring the giant rat and Roubini, is Bitcoin their 'client'? Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid) Are the payments monthly? Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? Or, alternatively, slowly ramp up the expenses based on deliverables. Asked a few times but answer so far. In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred? Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public? In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto? linnutee mentioned legal contracts, which contracts and with whom will be made?

On the text itself:

1. Please avoid using tracking bits in the links, e.g. `#1716b3851e51` in the forbes.com link or the `utm_xxx` in coindesk.com links. Anti-privacy tracking links are bad in general, but are even worse for a site that is visited by stakeholders.
2. `11.01.18 — 05.01.19`: please use international date format, month before day is [US-specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country). By the way a good PR direction is to make Decred look less US-centric.
3. Small and totally my personal issue: the ""industry experts"" and ""leaders"" are the ""business speak"" terms that are abused to the point they _lower_ credibility for me.

Signing with Wachsman means Decred does not have to worry about hiring an events team - we would cover you across the board from screening events, applying for speaking opportunities for your chosen representatives, helping with booth set up and ordering SWAG and more. The only thing Decred would have to worry about would be paying for the flights, hotel rooms, and tickets to the events themselves (although we are extremely good at securing discounts). For Decred specific events (hackathons, roadshows, etc.) we offer full support there as well.

> If too much attention is placed on Jake alone this can lead to decreased perceived decentralization of the project.

Ideally Jake would be one of many representatives - based on their area of expertise (i.e. a lead developer to talk to developer press). In a perfect world, a decentralized project wouldn’t have any centralized spokespeople - but in the current media and events landscape, they would be needed to communicate Decred’s story to the world and distinguish Decred from competitors. That said, Wachsman would work extremely hard to protect the decentralized nature of Decred -- it’s one of your best selling points and speaks to the very reason this industry was started in the first space! We would do this by working very closely with the community.

> What specific steps do you imagine to reduce the damage? Are there any historic examples?

There would be two main buckets here that would fall under our “rapid-response” engagement. 1. Manage, contain, and minimize negative publicity related to Decred, while developing a crisis strategy, contingency plan, and pre-approved drawer statements to prevent and mitigate any potential future crises. 2. Generate ongoing and regular content to strategically pitch Decred to media to ladder down negative articles about the network stall in organic searches. When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this) examples of crises that Wachsman is prepared to help mitigate include: platform/token hacks, regulatory intervention, subpoena requests, unfulfilled company promises, staff departures, technology flaws, investor withdrawals, token offering extensions, sharp declines in token value, social media account takeovers, security breaches, and consistent community/developer/media criticisms.

> Do you have an idea why Decred was omitted by CoinDesk for 2 years until recently, while extensively featuring projects with much less delivery?

You can be the best project in the industry and be excluded from the media landscape entirely without the right team in place to change that. The bar for coverage in CoinDesk (a Wachsman client) has risen significantly in recent months - but we’re well prepared to navigate that (including suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo). 

> Do you have any connections to attract more talented Go developers? Is it in the scope of this proposal? Growing developer base is important for long term sustainability.

Agreed 100 percent on the value of growing a developer base and there are several levers we can pull there. 1. A tailored media campaign to the publications we know developers are more likely to read. 2. A tailored events campaign to get Decred at the events we know developers are going to (including ones with job fairs) and supporting Decred in rolling out their own organic events - like hackathons for example. 3. Leveraging Wachsman’s Strategic Advisory Group that does this all the time. We didn’t list them in the day-to-day team members that will be supporting Decred because we didn’t want to misrepresent who will be supporting Decred daily, but this is an area that they would be well suited to help you with. As a bit of a background on them, they are headed up by Michael Chang and Franklin Bi. Michael previously served as Senior Vice President at Jefferies investment bank where he led the blockchain coverage effort. Prior to joining Wachsman, Franklin led the Blockchain Strategy group at JP Morgan. He helped lead the Quorum initiative and co-founded the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, among many other achievements. 

> Can you please comment on your influence in non-English space, and any plans in scope of this proposal?

One of the biggest focuses in hiring in our Singapore office has been fluency in other languages. While we focus primarily on English speaking media, we are well (and uniquely) suited to pitch Decred in other languages - we would likely rely on translation services for full releases however. 

> Will you allocate someone to talk to community in text chats and update how Wachsman-Decred project is doing?

Yes, absolutely. Decred’s community is one of the most important pillars of the project - we would look to include it across the board throughout this campaign. 

> Do you make any activity on social media? For example, if someone tries to pull an info attack on Decred using multiple Twitter accounts?

While (hopefully) this would not be part of our day to day activities, we would leverage our rapid response and crisis communications team to guide Decred through instances like this. 

> Can you use textual source formats (e.g. Markdown) for the materials you produce, and publish them on GitHub, to allow community members to contribute or re-use it in their work?

That’s a fantastic idea and certainly something we could look to do in the interest of keeping Decred’s community members as involved as possible. 

> Will you publish post-event analyses publicly?

Yes; happy to. 

> Where can I learn about the actual work performed for them? 

There is more info [attached in this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11v242zQ3bhj3aDaoKM7ZsrKexRIsqwA4Aez4mzXnQAw/edit#slide=id.g46600410e6_0_0) that goes into a bit more detail the nature of our campaigns. Happy to elaborate on any specific use cases. 

> How to interpret all the linked articles? Are they written by Wachsman or did Wachsman assist in publishing?

In terms of the linked articles, Wachsman focuses entirely on “earned media” meaning we leveraged our relationships with reporters and industry knowledge to generate pitches that we then presented to individual reporters based on their interests who then generated organic content of their own based on it.","2f3417508e5816f5238b6181028ee2ecf124b55306106c992bab775d37a018d98bc883f4d9d5935dbf368050c9a034730bfdc25ac5c5429bd33169828fcded0b","2e7b5d746bc2765a256ca0e379be18f72d1957eb4347247a1a23ee095a57d443","70","118262eae35780fd360c095fa554e862e34c5361414615fc422c25f6e92bbbb9eada2a7cab0126b0db84420566addd813396a0bcae7c899250bad15686b4aa0a",1540912904,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/70",2,2,2,0,0

These would fall under the idea of “expert commentary” -- leveraging industry trends or larger stories to insert commentary that further establishes Decred’s chosen representatives as wider industry experts -- not just Decred experts. This both keeps Decred regularly in the news and further establishes your representatives/Decred as one of the best and most experienced teams in the industry. 

> Did you work for Blockstream? (article about Liquid)

No, we have not. 

> Are the payments monthly?

Yes, they would be monthly.

> Is it possible to stop the (monthly) payments if stakeholders are not satisfied with the results after say 2-3 months? 

Yes, we have a standard 30 day out clause specifically to ensure stakeholders remain in control there. Frankly though, I would be shocked if you chose to use that clause. 

> In one of the comments you mentioned due diligence services. That is interesting, could you e.g. help screening exchanges and wallets that integrate Decred?

Yes, absolutely - that would be supported by the aforementioned Strategic Advisory Group. 

> Was the call you had with Decred representatives recorded and is it available to the public?

Not to my knowledge, but we would be supportive of the idea of doing so for all future calls in the interest of keeping Decred's community as informed as possible. 

> In case both Wachsman's and Ditto's proposals are approved, how do you feel about cooperating with Ditto?

Wachsman has worked with other PR firms in the past when our offerings were complimentary - working with a firm that focuses exclusively on Korean speaking media or reporters in the art vertical for example. In terms of working with another firm in the same space, I would have to echo Ditto's thoughts there - it would likely be redundant.

> When in comes to historic examples, while I cannot share those (and certainly wouldn’t list a 12 hour network stall for Decred in future public discussions like this)

I think here you mean carrying communication with other clients to not make Decred look bad. That's reasonable.

I'd only like to note that I see no problem talking about incidents in public. The 12 hour example was made up, but we had a real 9 hour stall recently. As seen [here](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/blocks?height=127080&rows=40), block 127072 was mined 9 hours after its parent. It was due to a sudden spike in hashrate, which is a good thing. Delayed transactions are not cool, but they were the only problem. All core software behaved as expected.

Cryptocurrencies do have incidents, post-mortems are openly published, and personally I find them as a good way to know the projects better by watching how their teams react. For example, the [report](https://www.dash.org/2017/03/08/DDoSReport.html) of the DoS attack on DASH left a good impression: the issue was handled rather fast, a report was posted, and a message saying ""there are people out there monitoring all the time"" conveyed.

> suggesting to Decred that they offer the Politea announcement to Brady Dale under embargo

Embargo?

> Can you elaborate on this question? (legal contracts)

Sorry this is me still wrapping my head around some aspects of Politeia. When discussing conflicts of interest, linnutee suggested that separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts"". That left me wondering if there are any contracts that Wachsman will sign with Decred, and what entity will be on the Decred side. I guess it is DHG.","36bf8e8f8bd233df2dcd800e9d54262858a917d05ec8ca9537e1d89c49c002f17fd995abc417a552f542861a06e556497f69e412ca3d0df5c57fb9ed5b04e201","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","72","bbf7e581ad236d3d63f9c25084a5a70461cb3222a0bb4c221040b76646799099f65558cd9f2bb90c4a8a431819661b121e595e521822b1c9040eed5dc8e81a0f",1540980934,0,0,FALSE,NA,"bc8776180b5ea8f5d19e7d08e9fcc35f0d1e3d16974963e3e5ded65139e7b092/comments/72",0,0,0,0,0

Correct, a lot of crisis communications includes minimizing coverage of the story as much as possible - or at the very least getting ahead of it so that when incidents do go public, like the DoS attack on DASH, we can control the narrative around those incidinents. Part of that minimizing coverage as much as possible means that we would do our best to prevent it from being brought up again at a later date — and as such wouldn't use it in public discussions down the line. 

> Embargo?

A lot of mainstream reporters — particularly those in this industry — won't go near news that has already been ""broken,"" meaning if a story about Politeia going live has already been picked up by a number of the smaller trade outlets, they won't go near them. With stories of this nature, Wachsman would bring the news to a very selected (and trusted) number of reporters in the space that we know will not break the story early. This allows major reporters to do their dilligence, have interviews with relevant parties, and fold coverage into their own editorial calendars ahead of us distributing the news far and wide at a pre-selected date. An example of this was eToro's launch into the United States. The Wachsman PR and Events teams worked for several weeks under embargo with top-tier reporters so that when Yoni Assia was on stage at Consensus announcing that they were launching in the American crypto market, several top tier articles went live at the exact same time.

> Separation of employees working for different accounts ""needs to be heavily covered in the legal contracts

Not a problem.

My perspective on what constitutes a good research outcome (which can probably be quite well inferred based on my [medium](https://medium.com/@richardred) and [github](https://github.com/RichardRed0x) accounts) may not be the same as yours, or some segment(s) of the stakeholder community.

That's why I think this could benefit from being plugged into Politeia in some way. We'll find out more in the next few days or weeks about whether Politeia comments and up/down voting scores carry strong signal from the stakeholder community.

In terms of putting this program into practice if it is approved, I am thinking about another Politeia proposal which is not intended to go for a ticket vote but instead is used for collecting comments about research ideas and using up/down voting to indicate preferences for and against pursuing them.

1. That depends on one's epistemological perspective I guess, along with the specific research question and methods. The purpose of collecting data and sharing it openly along with the analysis is to allow people to reproduce it and test alternative hypotheses. 
2. In my view the second proposal will be this opportunity. If I fell like this is going badly I will not make a second proposal and may end this first one before the budget is spent. Stakeholders will vote to decide if it should be an ongoing program by approving or rejecting the second proposal. I think that's about the right level for stakeholder approval of the program as a whole.
3. I'm not sure that estimating the total number of hours to be worked is going to help with estimating how many questions can be covered. That depends on the difficulty of the question and how deep the answer goes. The program will require a way for stakeholders to feed back on the quality of specific pieces of work though, I will try to add something about that.

2. This has been addressed in my [recent blog entry](https://blog.decred.org/2018/10/15/Politeia-in-Production/).  As monthly invoices are rolled up into a monthly payout, there is an auditing process.  If contractors are found to be billing large amounts without corresponding public deliverables, they are asked about their work, and can potentially have their invoice payment delayed.  This will become more automated over the next few months with the contractor management system.  Asking stakeholders to judge the quality of particular research strikes me as a bad idea because they don't necessarily possess the domain knowledge to judge the quality of that research, the same way most stakeholders are not in a position to judge code quality.

3. Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc.  Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved.

4. Bounties create a number of problems in the context of research, e.g. 2 people working on the same bounty, 1 gets the bounty, and the other has spent potentially substantial energy duplicating the other's work.  Bounties work well for things like software bugs, but even in a context  where it works well, it takes a lot of effort to manage such a bounty program.","be9f38dbf36dedf0b8233138e21091fa322148168fb78c5543234f40b4e4c55acc4f36833b622bf69f069932c325d0648dffad1f092936619cdbe5f7ec5dd40a","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","18","a568eb51dd086c5e14e2563b0b546454718e771cad897cc78e325487bbcff911b8ee9b7d17375d6481524e461b45cb96bb6826d0d2e4ce81a54e18d77982db0b",1539885820,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/18",0,4,2,2,0

So why don't we skip the public vote and appoint a board of accomplished developers like other academic institutions? The conundrum here is involving the _stakeholders_ in providing consensus to the allocation of _stakeholder_ funds. After all, Decred isn't a privately funded university.

An initiative like this can grant foresight through analysis, that will help evolve the project in a way that has strong intellectual foundations. 

Why I support this:

	- Provide data that the community can leverage for collective intelligence and ultimately informed decision making
	
Some areas of research areas relevant to Decred can be:
1	How to increase antifragility and protect agaisnt consensus failures or majority attacks.
2 	Gini coefficient, and state of decentralization.
3	Privacy Research, to what extent should privacy be implemented, does it contradict or clash nation state laws.
4	DAE applicable research like, contractor rates of pay, how to pay fairly and audit in a manner that does not remove autonomy.
5	Policies to enforce in the event of misbehaving miners.
	
These are just some examples of areas and not formulated research questions. I believe foresight is key to Decred and  uninformed and preconceived notion will be pushed around everywhere.

Specifically, from someone who is not close to the decred developers/contractors and their processes. I didn't know that most contractors start with a 12 hour week billing cap, for example. Thank you for that information, that's helpful and an example of what I wanted to learn from my inquiry. From looking at another comment, I also glean the following information - ""Hourly rates for Decred contractors are USD 20 / hour and up, depending on type of work, quality of work, etc. Everyone's hourly rate will not be shared publicly, so there is some negotiation involved."" If there is some kind of standard decred contractor process that will be followed, I'm not aware of any public documentation that outlines those details. If a standard decred contractor process is to be followed, that should be noted and documentation should be linked in proposal.

My questions still stand, that I would like to see a more detailed breakout of how the funds are budgeted (even if just napkin math with assumptions) before approving the proposal when it goes to voting. I don't have a lot of confidence in ""$10,000 should last a few months"" just at face value.

An example of what I'm looking for would be (given the new information provided since the original proposal):

**Budget**

_Assuming 4 new contractors would be brought on for this project with the introductory billing cap and billrate, the project has funding for ten weeks._

**_4 new contractors x 12 hours/week billing cap x 20 USD/hour x 10 weeks = $9,600]_**

This also provides transparency and accountability in the case billing were to vastly differ from a proposal budget. What assumptions were missed and by how much?

Great power hides behind this proposal. Sophisticated intelligence can help us make much better decisions. Someone knowledgeable could share the numbers, but I bet nation states spend a ton of money on intelligence.

After reading the prop for the first times I felt it is too abstract and that I don't fully understand what work will be done, so I see why people might be confused. Adding more examples of work would benefit this proposal. So I started writing down ideas for a few days.

## Existing work

First I realized that some in the spirit of this proposal _already happens_:

* [Politeia Digest](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9qnye8/politeia_digest_issue_1_a_short_weekly_update_on/)
* [Decred Journal](https://xaur.github.io/decred-news/)
* [@zubairzia's articles](https://medium.com/@zubairzia)
* [@permabullnino's articles](https://medium.com/@permabullnino)
* the [list of exchanges](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Iy2-3oqk-RUT7Fz0CaBcNI289o4YyAXBew86uNCCxQ/) supporting Decred, maintained by snr01 (has many exchanges not listed by coinmarketcap!)
* the new [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) repository
* please share any others you know

As zubairzia0 noted, this could be so much more. Wait for it...

## Decred Intelligence Group (DIG)

First I called it Decred Intelligence Agency (DIA), but DIG sounds more fun, right?

Below are some research ideas:

* Expand the [media tracker](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/decred-media-tracker) into more thorough ongoing monitoring project that would track articles on all languages, and possibly track videos and podcasts mentionin Decred. Then add additional datasets with subjective metrics like quality.
* Ask @permabullnino (Twitter [@ImacallyouJawdy](https://twitter.com/ImacallyouJawdy)) if he has any studies planned.
* Collect and organize info about services that support Decred. Services like exchanges, wallets, payment processors and such. Dig their backgrounds, try to see which are trustworthy and reliable. This also includes actually testing them. People do it already in #marketing before announcing integrations, but I see opportunities for this process to become more organized, involve more people and produce more knowledge. snr01 has a nice spreadsheet already, and I have some drafts on this.
* Track how ratings agencies rank Decred and maybe try to educate them.
* Write tools to automatically detect new first time contributors (I need this for the Journal)
* The definitive index of community discussions. Something similar to Community Discussions section in the Journal, but as a separate project with more frequent updates and wider coverage.
* An archive of event reports.

Then there are opportunities for more deep research that might have strategic value:

* Study the pain points of running Decred full nodes to get more people to run them.
* Track which projects build on Decred or btcsuite codebase. This can be useful for marketing, recruiting and harvesting upgrades for the codebase.
* Find and connect with communities that might be interested in Decred's mission, e.g. local open source hacker communities. This effort can collaborate with marketing people and benefit marketing and recruiting.
* Watch projects active in the governance space and learn from their experience. Maintain a list/analysis of projects, tech and ideas relevant to the governance sub-domain. Compare them to Decred, see if Decred could incorporate anything good.
* Analyze narrative in social media for a given subject. Example: this year there was a lot of criticism of on-chain governance and coin voting from prominent Ethereum contributors. As we figured, their criticism applies quite well to Ethereum but not so well to ""money only"" project like Decred.
* Monitor and analyze criticism, trolling and info attacks on social media. There were several cases when a few previously unknown Reddit accounts showed up and furiously attacked some aspects of Decred, representing themselves as parts of larger offended group (e.g. poorly handled contractors) and painting things in too dramatic ways. This is potentially damanging to Decred project and ideally should be detected and revealed to the community as quickly as possible. This could involve timing and linguistic analysis of messages. I did a few of such analyses for r/decred manually and I can say it consumes a lot of time.
* Analyze general social media sentiment towards Decred. This could involve going as far as automation with sophisticated crawlers and machine learning. Could be a collaboration with teams that already work in this domain, e.g. [BittsAnalytics](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/7vqaty/nice_sentiment_uptick_on_decred_based_on_our/).

Finally, there are some interesting topics I would like to see researched but they require expertise in fields like programming or legal knowledge, while some can be only done by the developers. Still, let's not them for completeness:

* Some areas of research that zubairzia0 noted.
* Collect interesting stats from the blockchain (see a few examples in the Network stats [here](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news/issues/2), but this will move soon).
* Stats from social media.
* What legal and tax status does Decred staking have in different countries?
* Watch the space of open hardware, look out for any devices to more securely run Decred. Perhaps even fund some (many have very nobel goals but suffer to get funded).
* Watch the topic of ASIC resistance and analyze interesting events.
* Watch the development of Lightning Network and produce short updates specifically targeted at Decred stakeholders.
* Why we should feel safe using Go, which is influenced by Google.

Regarding concerns about money waste: continued payouts are a good incentive to impress stakeholders with good intel so that they keep funding this project.","fd69a58cd1b1944147662a48a13727325e9558258bdb7c7b7eeb1cd65b6376f383455b4507462971ed9f8a14b0a013e6f0ff94a8b161eabd934b958550b96c08","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","32","e47e2728e481f4f98230b95e6322eac5a5e9ddbccfe50beffa1a85b0236397d559d531467414825989af9bfe6c0550e14c2eb76efe910c7db744d5dcf882510e",1540681713,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c68bb790ba0843980bb9695de4628995e75e0d1f36c992951db49eca7b3b4bcd/comments/32",5,5,5,0,0

I agree that work in the spirit of this proposal already happens (and count some of my own among it, like my analyses of the [Dash treasury](https://github.com/RichardRed0x/dash-analysis/tree/master)). 

It is not my intention that _all_ research work for Decred should have to go through this proposal. Anyone is free to take on some work they see value in and submit it for review in the usual way.

One of my aims with this proposal is about developing methods for the community to signal which research projects they see value in - so that people who do not have confidence in their read of what the community values can sidestep that issue and work on research projects that the community has signaled support for. Or, add their own ideas into the mix and see if the community sees value in them.

I like some of your ideas, and I like some of @zubairzia's ideas, but there are others I am lukewarm about. I don't see it as my place to decide whether each of those ideas are worthwhile or not. I think it would be sub-optimal to maintain a huge list of every research idea that a community member shares and say that we'll pay for work on any of those. Some have more value than others, and we should be encouraging people to work on the more useful projects, once we figure out what they are.

For clarity, this vote is currently for a 220000 USD equivalent in DCR budget for planned activities and 70000 for potential new activities, and would operate as a budget (where only actual cost/hrs are paid for activities and there is shared responsibility to end the year at or below the target budget)?  For example, if only 10 of the 20 suggested community members get local events rolling we might expect the end of year spending to come in at approximately 50,000 USD for that line item rather than 100,000?

a) $65000 is a very expensive for the amount of work speced out without much clarity on actual payrates. 

b) Community Organization plan for $100,000 without any small scale experimentation looks very suspect. This should be started small and proven. Better still, teams should approach decred directly without going through gatekeepers. Giving this budget to one person means creating unnecessary power centres and should be avoided at all costs. 

b) $70,000 in funds for an unspecified cause is a complete no-go for me. You should let the treasury decide this, otherwise what is the whole point of pi?

a) It looks like you have made the manual process unfriendly for independent contractors. There is no dearth of contractors willing to work provided the system gives them the chance.

Dash pays contractors upfront via blockchain- while this may not be the best way it certainly ensures an open, encouraging and democratic system.

I think we must keep in mind that decentralization will not happen instantly and it was never expected to. Most of the elements we see in this proposal are for types of work that are already being done and for which funding was allowed from the treasury by the DHG during the last 3 years.

I don't believe either that this proposal is the ""final level"" of decentralization that we hope to achieve. This proposal is however a clear shift in transparency and an important transition from the DHG management of the treasury. The key word here being ""transition"".

I also have a few concerns regarding the content of this proposal, although I understand the complexity of shifting how funding is managed and the implications for people already in place and currently at work.

From my experience when you have people who do excellent work, are productive and autonomous in your team, the last thing you want is to micro-manage them. Rather, you want to trust them and let them strive for greatness because that's when you get the most out of them. 

My first concern is on the timeframe of a full year, I would hope we eventually turn to more frequent and standard periods (like quarterly) for most stakeholder's budget approvals. I say most,  because there are a few domains where annual review would certainly be enough and make more sense. As we are in uncharted territory here, a year long period is a safer, although slower transition IMO.

My second concern is regarding the grouping of multiple elements in the same proposal. It does make sense for a marketing plan as a whole, but it does open the door to having more difficult votes if some elements are more ""controversial"" than others or if stakeholder see less benefits in an item.

For example: To me the Decred Assembly, Newsletter, Website updates, Podcasts, and Internship are no-brainers and budgets are within what we would expect of quality content for these types of work. For the other elements however, it's a lot harder for stakeholders to decide if budget is adequate and to envision what actual work will be done. I would be much more comfortable with a shorter timeframe for these elements.

As a side note, I could see future proposals presenting a year-ahead plan and budget like this, but requesting ~quarterly payments in follow-up proposals where stakeholders can evaluate progress and actual spending. That would most probably alleviate my concerns, and leave room to adjustments if needed, while keeping a way for increasing/lowering budgets or adding/removing elements, if conditions change during the year.","d1a1e96fd8e825de8c53290117085c84d798b97b40a506acab70bd2870b6f79e8000f73d658ae52bd02a205853424f90dc9a4a7f388fe4fc6a88a2f1090b0f0f","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","13","4648096edb9d02544f6edf1e1dfe3865763632952788b7b9ae03cc0c07bdacc76036b69f3d0f53aa75bb650fc0918d27b0b2acc7f0be128009df272fbab0a808",1550896526,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/13",11,13,12,1,0

If I'm wrong someone can correct me,  but this proposal would not hand over the total amount to an individual or put someone in a deciding position.  It's the exact opposite....

My understanding,  is that all work described in this proposal,  would be billed at an hourly rate by each community member to the upcoming DCC platform.  (Instead of the DHG). In the DCC platform, contractors in all fields, review work being done by their peers before payment is made. The goal is to eventually see all those steps including payment, automated, with no manual intervention in the treasury from the DHG.

This change explicitly remove gatekeepers to the treasury while giving autonomy to contractors, and ensuring peer review of every little detail being worked on (without involving stakeholders in micro-management of daily hours).

This method is a clear step towards removing individuals from power position, and having the collective stakeholders and contractors, manage this decentralized organization efficiently. It will definitely be harder and (eventually impossible) for someone to ""run with the money""  after those changes, than it was in the last 3 years.

Also, as all work need to be billed to the DCC, costs represents the total budget cap allowed by stakeholders and not the actual payment directly given to each person involved. If the work done and validated by peers on the website, end up to 40K$ at the end of the year,  nobody will have the possibility of leaving away with the remaining 25K$. Work still need  to be billed to the DCC and reviewed by peers before any payment goes out.

All parts of the puzzle may not be in place yet,  but I believe it's where we're going.

I think the key thing here is people should see these proposal as moving away from DHG to multiple contributors who manage different domains like marketing, events, development, research etc. I think that for future these types of proposals should be presented as ""Proposal for Marketing Management for 2019"", as this is clearly what it is.

We have seen a natural hierarchy develop in most areas where some people are more dedicated, experienced and talented and eventually start co-ordinating activities and other contributors seem happy to look up to them for guidance and advice. Some examples are bee(data management/information gathering), dustorf(Marketing), richardred(Research), davecgh(cryptocurrency fundamentals/programming & education). I think this is decentralization at work, devolving power away from one entity (c0/DHG) to multiple individual/corporate contractors.

It is exciting to see new people come in and fill the gaps. I think although people will balk at the term middle management but that is what has emerged naturally over time and we should probably formalize it with such transparent proposals.

At the very least, each section should have a further breakdown on costs. 
This should be a rule for Politeia. For instance. 3.5k per Decred Assembly. How much goes to the studio? If the figure is above 2k, understandable. If it is less than 2k, probably not. The point is you have to be completely transparent and not vague.

The same goes for the website and supplementary. 65k and 70k.
Looking at supplementary, how much per each person/contributor? The same for the website? Can you be more specific? How do we know this will be spent responsibly if it is this vague.

Adapt and improve Politeia's rules for breaking down costs.

I don't think it's appropriate to share my wage, as that's an invasion of my privacy and it will not be shared under the DCC format. I will say that my wage is a fraction of what i would be paid if I worked for a corporation, and like many contractors, I'm billing for fewer hours than I work. Additionally, I was part of the project for many months before receiving compensation of any kind, and only received it after jy-p instructed me it was time. 

My first contribution to the project was a user survey (shared in chat last May), which coincided with a key stakeholder survey and competitive analysis. This yielded a positioning strategy, which lead to the process of finding and vetting a PR firm, which [I detailed in this extensive blog](https://medium.com/decred/pr-in-politeia-process-progress-and-pitching-in-d88771183dd4). I then hashed out the messaging, seen [here](https://pastebin.com/E5L6u2RV), and I have been managing the PR engagement, which has seen Decred be prominently featured in Forbes, Fortune, Breaker Mag, Coindesk, and more. I've been managing events for some time, I've developed this plan, and I am eager to get started provided stakeholders approval.","4e3a22a43517c5a7f8a29c3bd95aed60998f72515f3a2392db5d9ee475b305205c391c8c1766cce7b0ddc1a501481c6e3dfd2b200d1dba0a982f9f1892c7b50d","2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","36","a6a6538756f308bc8fb279afad4d7dce0cdd73dcfd7f6da4573dae2aeb5db357c7859a7fdbbdf3b47c6e8b4d26b3c649ab85ea96b14c638989217d3dfc87f600",1551198075,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/36",4,10,7,3,0

Regardless of whether you agree or not with the proposal, please consider these points regarding the payment process of contractors following a proposal. (I've made some effort to dig up this information and confirm my understanding of how things works. The chat can be seen in the #proposals channel on matrix/slack). It was also agreed that the information is not readily available atm, as we are switching to the contractor management platform.

- This is not a proposal where the full amount is to be paid to the author like smaller proposals we had before.
- The author will not personally manage payment to sub-contractors from the requested amount.
- All work being done in the context of this proposal (including the author's time and contributions), will be billed in the form of an invoice to the contractor management platform)
- Work billed to the contractor management platform is reviewed by peers (other contractors in the same domain. i.e: coders review work by coders, etc..)
- Work is paid in arrears only, after review by peers.
- No payment can be made from the treasury with no reviewed work regardless of if there is budget left from the initial request.


The process described here is so that we now transition from:  The DHG reviewing work before pay, to contractors reviewing peers before pay, and does not involve centralized control of work review by the proposal's author.

This proposal is for stakeholders to decide if we allow the marketing plan described here to go forward, and have each contractor listed, begin billing for the authorized work to the contractors management platform. Payments will only go out in arrears, after review and up to the amounts voted by stakeholders, with no obligation of reaching the maximum allowed budget.","328726fc2761e47538c5e8407ec1f9652fa8292db806b9c127e59a74b4b6a00ac2fa502b8651a0bc0f2b0e4d8eb344aa20c021253359341557be0620a0ad110c","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","39","5dec4416bfee322907f35f3d4aacff8487c44cd3cd13d527955cd0c57d0a5f4750899aa9cb2ac2ce97b1ec4d7c1da932d840f0b408258626e9f1bb7cd1c35e0b",1551210308,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/39",6,8,7,1,0

Your concerns about transparency are legitimate. I just want to add a little context from the perspective of Decred contractor working in another domain, with no relationship to Dustorf. 

**a)** Decred contractors don't work here for the money. I don't know how much Dustorf makes, but I know I could make much more money elsewhere (was before I started working here). I took a massive pay cut because, like most, because it's a meaningful way to make a living. Part of that is not being micromanaged and having some privacy. If the stakeholders force more transparency and a negotiation around pay, contractors pay will likely go _up_, not down. I'm open to that conversation actually, as I believe better ""price discovery"" will allow the project to pay better while delivering the same or better value. But know that privacy and autonomy are a big part of the ""compensation package"" that allows stakeholders to get stellar talent on the cheap. 

**b)** re: jy-p trying to be the ""CEO of the treasury"", I sense that's been somewhat true (though to be clear, I don't have insight into this process). As far as I've seen though, this is common in any crypto project with a real budget. Some centralization is necessary at first, then projects decentralize over time. What is important is that there's a real commitment to decentralization and a plan, not just words. I would argue the fact we're having this conversation here is evidence of that decentralization happening. Before, this budget would just have been approved by jy-p and other ""insiders"" (again, don't know the process, but I'm assuming it was fairly centralized). But now, the power to approve budgets has been moved to _you_. Stakeholders _could_ vote this down. And further decentralization is continually discussed and planned (e.g. the DCC). The long game is to have funds literally managed by a smart contract, no humans. If you want this machine to keep going though, IMO you can't move too fast, or you risk good talent leaving the project because they don't have enough financial security to stay even if they wanted to (we're not all crypto rich, able to go long a volatile, risky asset with every paycheck). 

Again though, your concerns are legitimate. And moving the conversation forward. And inspiring me to spend half an hour writing this even though I can't bill for it.","8561f92a9a5ebc7a9b7e68cc985e02b7c48396178d8e87b83e97b44aca2cda0d99e6e3328cba4670fae53de6a81a2efaa6026680869618a52bef6fff76f83c01","1f7ce5046ed6e3de08601af20c3e9ad02fe5be81cd0d6f186995ad13d3de0a73","40","87824ebe9d61a8bfe36f530179061218e77406b71925ac9b30604212b35bb902773ffe9857e00f6de24f475c9967a11bd7e82b6892444d6745dbcd953f70ba04",1551212138,0,0,FALSE,NA,"c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e/comments/40",8,8,8,0,1

It's perfectly OK to vote no to this proposal if you believe there are issues with it; some people are doing just that. There are also people who are probably confident enough in voting yes, solely based on the track record of past expenses, as the treasury has grown to a sizeable amount during a period where the DHG really could have run with the money, but didn't, and delivered instead. If we were able to know exactly who voted yes or no and to which amount the system would be broken and a privacy risk  for all stakeholders. The idea is that instead, we know for sure that those who vote, do so proportionally to how much stake (risk) they have, regardless of who they are.

Regarding disclosure of personal information, personally I would fight any initiative stripping away privacy from anyone involved in Decred (contractors, devs, stakeholders, users, miners, etc...). Or straight up sell all my holdings if privacy was removed by design. Decred aims to be a decentralized organization not a surveillance agency.

That argument fall short also if you take a common organization like a company, the hours / salary of every identified employee isn't public information.

It doesn't prevent people from reviewing work and expenses.
It doesn't prevent someone to get fired if he's not delivering.
It doesn't prevent shareholders from approving/refusing budgets.

Sure it's a different model entirely when your goal is decentralization and there's no central planning entity,  but keep in mind that until we're replaced by robots, we're still dealing with humans, privacy and trust.

Same. I got much more on my previous job for a corporation.

In Decred it is a challenge to maximize the billable fraction of time spent here because there's just so many interesting things to do, but you only get paid for useful work.

On top of that, add that contractors who invoice the Treasury directly absorb the full volatility damage. Sometimes this is very not pleasant and I believe it can damage the retention of work force.

As soon as strong critcism of nepotism springs up, the people asking uncomfortable questions of the private club will be branded as trolls and censored in some way or another. Others will be discouraged from voicing criticism in subtler indirect ways.

Founding teams misuse their votes and position to grab all resources (or give it to chosen ones) and control the project by proxy. When they are accused of this, they will say, bring proof  that they are controlling the votes (knowing full well nothing can be proven).

Valid criticism is encouraged.

Playbook to be branded as troll: repeat the same thing over and over again, use half-baked arguments, be over the top/emotional, abuse bold font, refuse to share your useful contributions or to simply admit their absence while asking someone's tangible results, ask to reveal wages while refusing to reveal equivalent private info of yours, undermine someone who was building trust for months while you have none, etc etc.

Only major issue I have is the limiting the scope of projects to accept bug reports. 

In the end, I think we really only want bug reports on ""active"" projects that are out of beta.  So this would include: dcrd, dcrwallet, decrediton, dcrdata, politeia.  But would not include: insight, copay due to their obsolescence and dcrandroid/dcrios due to them being still alpha/beta.","2d76e9f2ef4513d6936a164b061738977d71e5c8542c59183d68102216aaa2295c622e1e2e5bcec72968837f6a4003ea7ef3d2d1ea7f51cf4893601bb116a20d","49ea685dac6e302503c7d21a72086028d97a5d4aef04fcd4bbed19618e83d997","1","dc4f7da46e1f1872aae089c5900f12d2d0581c45d4a3b4e885e6ac98471105d8ea1064d24fab847c50494a0a0bc8889beadbb4d9d65d8455a1ba327079b9fe02",1543941707,0,0,FALSE,NA,"d33a2667469b56942adf42453def6cc2292325251e4cf791e806939ea9efc9e1/comments/1",7,7,7,0,0

chappjc:
Oh, and I want to warn early on that dcrstakepool may need to be treated differently, at least to start.  It was supposed to have gotten love from the operators, but alas, the open source mentality is not too strong when there's competition it seems.
I know for a fact that when critical bugs have been identified in the past, certain pools had mysteriously already patched themselves for a supposedly newly discovered bug.
Expect people to pop up and demand money to port their fixes.
That's the idea I guess, but we should be aware there might be a flood of this kind of thing for dcrstakepool
I'm referring to bugs in the past that can do things like crash the process, or eat CPU.  AFAIK, there aren't any severe hacks

chappjc:
TBH, it needs a version 2, nearly fresh.

degeri:
Thanks for the heads up. We can edit the the minimum criticality to high and above if we face such issues.

* Is there (or will there be) a breakdown of 2018 events expenses?
* Based on indirect observations I always perceived Consensus as a money making machine for the organizers. Note that events are completely not my domain, I'm just curious as a stakeholder. iirc Decred was on one Consensus before, was it worth the ~$50K and why?
* I would love to see Decred in front of [CCC and FOSDEM](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/83) attendees, they might have a ton of engineers for whom 'sovereignty' means something. Is facilitating those in the power of this proposal?
* Reporting was a common omission for events. There was very few reports, a lot of talks were not recorded, the information was not nicely organized. Now that event expenses are brought to stakeholder ratification, it is reasonable to agree on reporting schedule. Ideally, for every event there is someone responsible for producing and sharing a report that would include (or link to) a text writeup, total expense and any recorded photos/video/audio. Ideally, all reports are organized in something like decred-events repo, while large media materials are self-hosted on some file server.

* I broke apart the Events from the Marketing Proposal because I didn’t want to present too much in a single proposal. Events were a primary tactic of Decred last year, so it seemed like a natural split. I’ve broken out the local meetups from these events because the meetups are done more autonomously by community members across the world. These events are slightly more centralized, as they’re planned by the Decred team in Matrix, not simply any individual who wants to coordinate something for Decred. Based on the input I’ve received on each proposal, I might propose more than two to break out separate, chunky ideas as their own proposals.

* As a disclaimer, I was not involved in the event decision making process last year, and I was only involved in the planning for WebSummit. I understand what was done and why, and I believe there are certainly areas where we can optimize our presence. I’ll speak to those later, as you ask explicitly in your last question.

Last year, the project had stronger purchasing power and event attendance was strong. It’s easy to see why the decision was made to attend the events we did. Whether it was worth it is an interesting question, in part because there’s no counterfactual we can point to. I’ve seen many of the benefits myself when I talk about events and marketing plans for 2019 in that these events have brought our community members together, expanded our community, and enabled cooperation. Examples:

At NABTC in January, 2018, the Decred team met Sid Maresh, who is now, more than a year later, helping to organize the San Francisco community with regular Decred meetups. The first one is March 6, 2019 featuring Luke Powell and the Placeholder VC team. This is a strategic area rich with devs fluent in Golang. There’s massive potential to add devs, expand the community in a strategic location, and bring more contributors to the project.

In 2018, Decred attended events across Europe, enabling communities to form that have become autonomous. The UK team and the Polish teams have formed bonds and are working on behalf of Decred without the need for centralized coordination. I propose one large event per continent, in large part, to enable teams to form that can operate more autonomously in their region.

* Expenses for the 2018 events were given to me as a single, lump sum approximation by jy-p. I would bet that he prefers to spend his time on new features rather than old accounting, but that’s up to him.

* Consensus is likely the most important annual event because it attracts the right people. Relationships with individual contributors, developers, media, other contributors and potential partners in the ecosystem, media, and strategic partners matter. It’s the single place everyone congregates, and the face time we get is where we can help solve challenges such as a lack of liquidity, lack of awareness, and so on. Trading volume was extremely high around that time, and the value of Decred was extremely high, particularly in relation to BTC. It’s not the place you’ll find bee, but it has value to the project.

* CCC and Fosdem are definitely in play. In the past, I’ve attempted to get traction for Fosdem and GopherCon, but the point of failure has been the unwillingness of Decred team members with strong technical skills to attend the events. It’s only developers who can vet other developers, so they’re a necessary component. If you can help facilitate their attendance, I’m in full support.

* Events happen, but it’s critical to maximize the value and the legs of the events. We can do this through reporting, which can help us improve and optimize our presence and spending. Heyvj has established a method for documenting events [here](https://github.com/heyvj/decred-events/wiki/Event-Report-Template), which I’ve contributed to for NABTC, and which will be a standard practice for all events covered in this proposal. These should be completed within one week of the event.

As you mention, events generate content of two types where Decred can more strongly convert upon going forward. The first part, you mention is video content. When Decred representatives speak at events, they demonstrate authority on a topic, and we would like to propagate that as much as we can. I believe we can leverage that content both on YouTube, as well as our updated website. The second type of content we can leverage is simply imagery related to the events. JZ has brought up the idea of always having a designated photographer at an event to document things. This helps yield social media content in real time, and also contributes to a digital asset repository that has multiple benefits, including for media coverage.","58e93b0fbb0e02698addaa604f9f11edae1d0ee79787d8c90c6a8799549649d5eecacdf6840a862600644e5fe473b63b9f862f30df348d2fb60c3be32c850608","2cfe1335346e419a3f00fc3672c1a53ebcc1c15f48d3e9e174af7356be14bc5a","14","231c9370ece084e52ceb22722f390e70e5dd61657945f7e8bdc07d8f22c89d3d349d6d1d70ecb85a8affcfe312affaa172c419ecdeeeb2927ac572b288021502",1551286212,0,0,FALSE,NA,"d3e7f159b9680c059a3d4b398de2c8f6627108f28b7d61a3f10397acb4b5e509/comments/14",1,1,1,0,0

You've listed various developer pay rates, but it looks like a significant portion of the work will be done at $25/hr. I'm a bit skeptical of quality work being performed at that pay rate.

He was enthusiastic, had a lot of buzzword-y things to say, and was told about the process to become a contractor for the project.  In the months since then, he and other REUM staff have made zero effort to become contractors.  As such, we have no experience with their work product, and it seems clear they are not interested in engaging with the existing contractor community.

That said, I see a number of things that are alarming with this proposal.  To avoid being sucked into making an epic and detailed reply to this proposal, I will post my criticisms as a set of succinct bullet points:

* REUM and its staff have made no real effort to engage the existing project contractors or the wider community prior to this proposal.
* REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.
* REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
* Creating a functional DEX is a technical project.  Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.
* This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.
* The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
* The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.
* Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project.  The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
* The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.
* The proposed timeline is unrealistic.
* Creating a proposal based on an idea and simply pointing at some dev shops when it comes to the implementation runs contrary to the spirit of the project.

Decred currently has no exchange, thus no way of sharing DCR with other blockchains, crosschain technology and wallet to wallet transactions, which our developers can provide, will go a long way to providing Decred with a closer relationship with consumers, securing the coins future which is decentralised but also inclusive.

The Mastercard program is a 'closed loop' debit card, meaning it can only be used with Decred (DCR), but can be used to purchase products in store, not to extract cash from an ATM, it is decentralised by nature, because it is essentially an extension of DCR embedded into a card.

as stated in last comment, I have been very busy and did attempt to engage, but time meant I was unable to keep up with all communications, although I did stay up on as much as i could.

    REUM has not demonstrated that any of its staff are capable of generating work product that is useful to the project.

OK, I have no answer for this, as we have not had a chance to show or prove anything, obviously not looking like we will get this chance, willing to build Decredex in the way we stated and prove it is possible.

    REUM does not have a track record of creating open source software.
    Creating a functional DEX is a technical project. Nothing in this proposal or on the company website convinces me that REUM has the technical capacity to complete this work.

Currently building (as project managers) for several organisations, including other currencies and some of the larger exchange businesses, can show you these projects as they are developed, established then launched, again I can see Decred has a way of doing things, was planning to place a developer and communication staff member on to the project, if I had got positive feedback, but Democracy is what is, so the check and balances have found me as not capable, I guess I need to look at myself a little in this instance. 

    This proposal and the REUM site are full of buzzword-saturated marketing speak.

I can back up every 'buzzword' with facts, but again please be specific I will rebuttal each point constructively and concede where I must concede.

    The REUM website has a section called ""Reum Brand Agency"" where they suggest using Instagram models and celebrities to promote ICOs.
    The claimed partnerships with Nasdaq and Mastercard strike me as a huge overpromise and unrealistic.

I am in talks with Nasdaq and will be hiring them to provide trade security and compliance, I am head of Europe at http://moentum.com which is SEC Approved, so ready to discuss my Mastercard https://www.prosper2.co.uk/ and Nasdaq https://business.nasdaq.com/market-tech/ contacts in detail if you wish, I have several executive connections, this is why I did not have time in the forums and social networks, I was speaking with enterprises! 

    Attempts to proactively engage regulators in the US and UK strikes me as preemptive and likely to generate negative attention for the project. The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.
    The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.
    The proposed timeline is unrealistic.

The point of a DEX is to have permissionless exchange.

The permissions element was for DCR OTC services KYC/AML, the actual DEX would be metamask enabled, so yes fully decentralised.

The proposed budget suggests to me that REUM has very limited experience running a business.

How! please read the above paragraph!

The proposed timeline is unrealistic.

Surely they could have provided more technical details, if they have been working on it for 8 weeks already? There are no technical specs, not even which programming languages they are planning to use.

One paragraph in the ""How"" section of the proposal did it for me:
> We are humbly requesting for the Decred Organisation and the Politeia fund community to assist REUM and to invest in our knowledge pool to the benefit of Decred (...) All your files are listed in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the list.

In the ""How"" section you are supposed to explain _how_ you are going to implement the proposal. This paragraph contains the message ""we need the Decred community to tell us what to do, because we don't have the required knowledge / skills to build this DEX ourselves""

I asked for an explanation ""in detail""; a single hyphenated word is not ""in detail.""

I am a developer, I can understand technical terms. You mentioned elsewhere that you're not a developer, I understand that, get a developer that will be working on the project to explain stuff then. 

- Is there a single centralized order book server?
- Is the order book managed by a federation of servers?
- Can anyone run their own order book server?
- Or is the order book fully p2p?

> wallet to wallet transactions

Not sure what you're trying to say; let me give an example to clarify my question:

Alice has USD and wants to buy DCR from Bob with her USD. Now, how does Alice pay her USD to Bob? Directly, or is there an intermediary? What prevents Bob from keeping both the USD and DCR? Or, if Bob sends the DCR first, what prevents Alice from getting the DCR and never sending the USD?

1. Not nearly every cryptocurrency has its own exchange.
1. I assume you are aware that the DCR team [were pioneers](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap) in the space of cross-chain atomic swaps? So I'm not sure how your developers can provide something we already have...
1. ""wallet to wallet transactions"" What does that even mean? DCR can be sent between wallets just fine currently, so I'm assuming you must mean something else that isn't obvious to me ATM.

But there is little details on the: financial objectives, business strategy, organizational structure, relations with and obligations to DCR, expectations and goals, etc or even what branch is it expected to live one. 

Would consider any real meat on this, if the investment asked would have good returns balancing out the risks, e.g. how much of your business would DCR own and how can that be solved legally (if it even can be done)? How quickly would you pay back the investment from DCR treasury and in what terms would this generate revenue towards DCR treasury? 

Certainly don’t see it becoming the next Binance or Coinbase. These ships have sailed. Neither is it a decentralised exchange or competing with those in production. What bothers me the most is the real term “decentralised exchange” not being respected here. As if it’s tied to fiat, credit card services etc then by no means can you call it a decentralized exchange. 

If the likely outcome is another low-tier exchange, would be a waste of project funds imo. I see no point in competing with rest of them and can expect huge risks considering how much trust and security issues these various smaller exchanges have in their track record. E.g. this being super close under the Decred umbrella – gets hacked or business goes bad = very bad rep for DCR. Personally I think there are enough of these fishy exchanges that do no favours to the whole cryptospace.

We would offer the Decred organisation 100% of all the revenue, thus proving ourselves over a long term period, we are a small group so it would be difficult to communicate consistently with the community while building the DEX, we left out GUI element from the budget request, as we can provide this element in house.

business strategy:

it is just a part of our plans to grow into an exchange service provider, which will bring us enterprise level clients, to build their exchanges revenue and business is paid up-front for exchange delivery, then the buyer keeps all exchange trade profits and arbitrage fees revenue.
 
organizational structure:

REUM Ltd, based in the UK, as a project management team alongside some external developers.

relations with and obligations to DCR, 

To introduce a REUM tech and communication staff members to engage Decred and to join as a contractor and to walk through all of the rules of engagement with Decred, we are conceding on this proposal, but we will come back positively and prove our worth to Decred.

I am not perfect myself, but I'd implore you to deploy empathy & think harder about the human at the other end of your keyboard. I think it's pretty apparent that we have a full team who have all put immense effort into the project to date and for you to suggest that we think Decred is a charity we can just sign up for when we're ready to make it rain is a straw man argument at best. As you'll start to see on the vlog as episodes go up, we've been working on this proposal for ~two months. It would be much appreciated if folks could read the proposal thoroughly enough not to need to be informed of its contents later, after having already responded. I also think the juvenile nature the #proposals room in Slack exhibited was...surprising. It was unbecoming of the team, and not what I would expect from the only crypto network with working on-chain governance in production. (since 2013!!)

We're here in good faith to take and integrate feedback because we believe in the ethos of Decred, too! I can certainly appreciate a bit of sticker shock; making games is expensive! We really think that setting an example for the games industry to turn their gaze our way will propel Decred & the entire crypto ecosystem further forward at faster pace than we've seen to date. As I say in the proposal, a high tide raises all ships: we are stronger when we work together! We do not consider ourselves a private business any more than Company Zero was at Decred's inception, and we intentionally only referenced the Airdrop & Fairdrop plans, imagining myriad more models would be suggested by the community as some helpful folks have!

We've found when studying the crypto space in macro that games are how the rest of the world is looking toward the space to prove its worth and spur mass adoption. (everyone here knows sound money is reason enough, but most need more than that) Some game developers are interested, but the space is still so nascent that many of the major concepts are still so obtuse, and games don't yet support or even understand the infrastructure to support them. To reference [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant), [platforms follow the application](https://www.usv.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-infrastructure-phase). We have a long view; Baeond is dogfood for a larger Proof of Play protocol that we anticipate will enable industry veteran game designers to create permissionless & autonomous games. We're here for the long haul and think Decred is the wagon to hitch to.

We possess an agility Decred does not when it comes to experimentation, so we're looking to join forces and grow alongside, not unlike how MimbleWimble/Grin has been handling [forks](https://mw-w.ink/leer/index.php/flavors/). Someone in the Slack made the comparison to this prop effectively being a satellite dev team Decred would be funding, and yes! That's exactly the ticket! We don't see any value in shouting at the team to support features we'd need for a game & we don't see a lot of promise in other base layer projects just yet. The space is ripe for experimentation! We want to help start a more nimble arm of development around Decred. We really don't think anything could be healthier for the Decred network at this stage in time. 

For now, I'm updating the prop to reflect an ask of 11K $DCR disbursed over 7 months. I'm working on a quick writeup for the end of the week on some of the specifics of we're doing to support LN swaps with DCR, NFT support, a Politeia facelift/UX breakdown(Hi, design team, if you're reading! I'll be reaching out to you on Github soon!), and a few very new, very untested ideas we look forward to putting through their paces.

The treasury is not a venture capital fund, politeia isn't a platform to allocate grants. And stakeholders are not a group of investors looking to spend money on random cool ideas (even if they are really cool).

The treasury is a precious and fragile insurance policy. It's the energy source to keep Decred evolving, growing staying secure, implementing required changes, and staying relevant in the future ahead.

At the moment, the primary question that anyone who want to make a proposal should ask beforehand IMO is:  Who is the primary beneficiary of this proposal? ""  If the answer is not Decred or the Decred ecosystem, or the Decred Community,  expect strong opposition from stakeholders..

That's how I view the treasury and its purpose. That being said,  I could envision within a few years, when things are going nicely and we have a better picture of our treasury and operation costs, a proposal being made to set aside a small % of the treasury specifically in a separate fund that itself,  could be used to allocate grants, donations, or to fund various ventures like this one. 

But it's way too early for that, and way to risky. It could put us in a position where allocated funds to a ""cool idea"" would hinder Decred's future development.","bd8f96cdc91bd58d2e7676e2dde292b90af4eedc1b5b5f2849b29c24a5479bb79ae5b4158c5e60eaedf5fa4f2cfe9a29855bdd8d31a480f8be4399e2127fc701","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","14","30d0e825d5e5160f5d295b45c7d59b3786e0393c1d30712373a23ceca82854dadee0006361dca1350a47c3d5e4d45eb4b4a93fcfbd61ea94c679e79cffd78d02",1546395151,0,0,FALSE,NA,"f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/14",13,13,13,0,0

While Baeond may end up being a very cool game, I don't see how it directly benefits the project, beyond it integrating DCR support at a later date.  There is no existing network or service, so this is effectively funding an idea/vaporware nearly from scratch.

Historically, the project has only financially supported development of open source software.  Will this game be entirely open source?  That is unclear to me after carefully reading the proposal.  Funding closed source software development creates serious transparency problems since work cannot be verified prior to payment of monthly invoices.

I think it's neat that they plan to use DCR's hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm as the basis for their chain.  However, I find the entire ICO model to be questionable, both ethically and legally, and by funding this proposal, we would become entwined with it, per ""after the crowdsale next year"".

Others have voiced this same concern: it is not clear what Decred gets in exchange for DCR 11K (previously 13K) in funding (roughly USD 200K).  It appears that the promise of Baeond coins being airdropped to DCR users is the main return from this investment, but I see no quantification of how many coins would be airdropped.  Further, the model here appears to be ""in exchange for objects with established value (DCR), I want to sell you a promise"".  I see little utility in using the Decred Treasury to fund such VC-like dart-throwing, and we have limited recourse in the case they do not deliver on their end of the deal, i.e. the airdrop.","5ba6f1b49fceb70f36f022471aa647fd93a2d11657ed9f7ba5f827ff00038ceef9701f687021fc41dd166b991d55062d0ad705dc490fb7da3c4d9af86cd7b105","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","16","d12d15a4d81a8baf26e293055bf3d0e8bb1a1ab74f8b81b3256d54bf281c40ebb50f22046a1b2857269c2c35140a0914b92fd4d2bd6dc57f1169a98c2e9ae307",1546435917,0,0,FALSE,NA,"f545b359fcf1b40b356e9cb556cb422cc7ff01b628b577f804cdc45ce414f5dd/comments/16",9,9,9,0,0

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean every different wallet that has held at least one voting ticket throughout Decred's history?

I don't think Decred stakeholders will vote for a proposal that aims to pay individual stakeholders back with card packs, in any case. The Treasury is not an investment fund and payments are not intended to generate a return for stakeholders.

Baeond seems like a cool game and it would be great to see you develop it using Decred as a foundation. It is not something the Decred Treasury should fund, in my opinion, because it asks for a significant sum of DCR to do things that are not well connected to the project's objectives, and which are unlikely to deliver significant value in that regard. $200k moonshots are not the kind of signal stakeholders should be sending about the (still young) Treasury's aspirations.

But I also understand the question being raised regarding smaller contributions.

Let's take for example someone who has built a small tool or utility software that doesn't fit in current repos around Decred. This person may be a talented dev and the community may benefit of his work, but he may not necessarily have the time or desire to get a DCC by contributing in other parts of the project before submitting his work.

Could maybe these smaller contributions be an alternate path to obtain the DCC? Or maybe we could have a special repo for smaller and new initiatives where people can submit their already completed work without having the DCC?

Regarding voting fatigue, someone could manage payments in this ""special"" repo each month. Itself becoming the proposal for the sum of the contributions seen as valuable. But we would be back to having a gatekeeper or elected official for this task unless we manage to decentralize the process or have some other way to validate what is considered valuable or not by the community...

Also, this raise the question of what would happen if someone submit a small proposal for already completed work, for which the community is highly in favor, but the developer behind it has no DCC, and maybe no experience to contribute in existing repos?

I am in full support of it, the only question I have is about the number of contractors required to grant or take a DCC. Would it work if we set a more dynamic number, perhaps via percentage of contractors, of a specific subdomain?

You wrote:

This is exactly my worry, that it would be 3 people who are of the same entity. Does ""ideal"" mean it will be just hoped for, as opposed to enforced? Enforcing this would be difficult. 

So my question is, would you be open to the idea of experimenting with a different number or perhaps a percentage, as opposed to a fixed number 3? And what was the rationale behind arriving at that number?

1. This system strikes me as inherently vulnerable to politics & corruption. I don't think we can engineer that fact away; we're dealing with something that we can't have the stakeholders directly vote on, due to the domain knowledge required. As a result, this particular process is quite similar to representative democracy (and we all know how that tends to work). Just something to keep in mind, and ensure proper checks and balances to compensate.

2. How much should soft skills factor into issuing DCCs? For example, a developer writes good code, but:
   - Has very poor written English skills, making communication with other developers very difficult. Or:
   - Is extremely abrasive to co-workers; uses explicit language to refer to other developers and/or their work when things aren't done his way.
  
  On one hand, soft skills are important; on the other hand, this could be taken too far. Different people have different views on what is acceptable behavior, and I wouldn't like to see a conflict similar to a US Senate appointment battle over a DCC.
3. > These votes would be made by individual DCC holders, not the corporate entities they work for.
  
  That's a pretty big assumption. If we're designing a system that's supposed to be robust in adversarial circumstances, we should assume that corporate entities will attempt to force their employees to vote a specific way. Either we need a system that can work in such a case, or we need strict rules and clearly defined consequences for corporate entities engaging in such behavior (e.g. revoking the corporation's ability to bill for X amount of time). I would prefer the latter option.
4. All-contractor votes being weighted by hours billed seems reasonable, but I'm wondering if such a system could be susceptible to a group of contractors that have performed the majority of work in recent history using this power to either operate a cartel ensuring only they are allowed to work on Decred, or enforcing the status quo and not allowing new developers using newer technologies to work on Decred, resulting in technological stagnation.
  
  This could possibly be done if the DCC holders cartel tells the stakeholders that the developers being excluded from getting DCCs are writing genuinely bad code. If most of the stakeholders are non-technical, they will likely assume the existing DCC holders are telling the truth, and allow the cartel to go on right under their noses.

  Perhaps I'm just being paranoid here, and I do admit this scenario is probably pretty unlikely, but it's still worth considering all possible cases IMO.","2ecdad63d57a2370e80e0841eb33222d45e40a5f26868e5d7d724945b5dd211b8b0c9fc2a43399340c7f04603ab91393afe618aa2c2173dd86270158716de000","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","12","a1ab1c2c71b39a6c0ec28572347d7a25d82777e2664d6332c929b79905c22591e8fb76be8854b9171ccd9418e140e29e4ef48f794b8dde7506a5988c1166850e",1540044035,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/12",13,13,13,0,0

1. As currently written, this system seems to be highly vulnerable to political preferences in getting more work for their own contracting company, conflict of interests or personal grudges.

For example: 2 Development Contracting companies. Company A has 5 developers and Company B has 1 developer. Company A can agree to revoke companies B DCC to get their work.

**From proposal:**

> It is ideal for these 3 contractors who vouch for an issuance or revocation to not be from the same corporate entity, whenever possible, and, more generically, to be independent of one another. Auditing these DCC issuance and revocation proposals for conflicts-of-interest will be an ongoing task.

In my opinion, the contractor's company should have 1 vote. For example Company A with 5 members has 1 vote, Contractor Company with 1 member has 1 vote. 

If left as is, some contracting companies will have a monopoly over the entire project or a branch. I don't think it's healthy for the future of the project.

2. Subdomain voting for granting or revoking DCC.
Having 3 contractors in a subdomain vouch for the issuance or revocation of a DCC forces those contractors to have skin-in-the-game when it comes to staffing decisions.

For example, some contractors work and contribute to multiple subdomains: design, social media/marketing, and events. Taking into consideration votes from only 1 subdomain would be not sufficient.

3. Sub-Contractors
I totally agree on the need of clearing sub-contractors that work for DCC contractors.

4. Stakeholders
Ultimately, some decisions will go to stakeholders for a final approval as we may not be able to resolve by internal voting.

Overall, this is a step in the right direction an I'm looking forward to more comments and ideas.

If someone gives feedback that is particularly negative, I will circle back and speak to other contractors in that subdomain.  Assuming there is not substantial contention about adding the new contractor, the addition occurs.

Regarding more complex threshold algorithms, I suggest we make a point to get a simple working system in place first, then it can be modified based on what we observe happening with the simple system.  I am totally open to exploring the algorithm for these proposals, but it's important we have a working system before we attempt to optimize it.

1. Every system is vulnerable to politics and corruption.  This proposal is an attempt to make staffing for the project not require my or any other project oracles' involvement.

2. The extent to which soft skills factor into this varies across subdomains.  Historically, we really don't care much about language skills so long as people can adapt to feedback and work constructively within their subdomain.

3. If a corporate contractor is found to be engaging in contractor vote manipulation, the punishment can be determined by an all-contractor vote.  I obviously can't speak for other corporate contractors besides Company 0, but I am really keen to stay out of these kinds of conflicts and let the individuals duke it out.

4. Regarding cartel behavior, which has been shown to be emergent in some systems, or other collusive behavior, this is exactly why I proposed the ability to escalate this to a proposal for stakeholders to vote on.  The scenario you describe is roughly what has happened with Bitcoin, but I have also seen some legitimately bad code that merits scrutiny.  If the stakeholders can be fooled into buying into arguments that boil down to an appeal-to-authority, we have more serious problems than the DCC model.","7d048c7a1370a542813b6b68ca82f489e7ce7c226973167e0c97a8189f9a2cb603264b48cabdc372f4956e5b6c969961505b4833e6411e948a130ba7b5199408","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","21","961111bf90090fcef40b552242e2b6fdfe475582bcc68bf114d7be6742e4994fda81b6b23480ea4ce0dc46324a91df3e6edc0be5a205b65552c3592f86257007",1540069072,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/21",8,8,8,0,0

In several cases, outright termination was the only real option for contractors who were overbilling and under-delivering.

1. Per my response to ryanzim, every system can be gamed.  There is an escalation process that can address punitive or self-interested actions.  The current system where I mediate these conflicts, or where they are mediated by some other person or group, are also vulnerable to gaming.  Even in the design subdomain where you do some of your work, there are several groups performing work, not just one entity.  This diversity applies to most subdomains, AFAICR.  Corporate contractors only having a single vote creates a substantial incentive against being a corporate contractor, whereas every individual DCC holder being able to vote reflects the skin-in-the-game more accurately.

2. Regarding working in multiple subdomains, I think that it could make sense to allow for a DCC to apply to one or more subdomains, and partial revocations to occur.  It would also make sense for a multi-subdomain contractor to be allowed to vouch in their corresponding subdomains, but their all-contractor vote would be handled the same way as everyone else's.

3. I'm glad you see the value of the subcontractor DCC, as I've dealt with this already and found it quite frustrating.","2305735873bb504f2ba06eaad2e2ca34f0da62e75023d7c86d3ef5d8414f381906747b31ff50073704829fd42f5b0690e984eec831651016d0ad8e0a3a402e0d","e575447e1acb624bedb7c7934f291e3c1b51bb7223f2c06647e551e4cf93f360","22","690c7b15ba04f563cf1cd9d55ae8f02abbba7b40807223e6479514ac1b557b75e5c42d96437e9c44e0d8efa143aa12395dbc1216ec2a44d86a2dbb61a656e407",1540070268,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/22",8,8,8,0,0

What i am suggesting, however unfavorable it may seems for delegating decision making to a single entity, this process will streamline the contractor hiring process. It is far more efficient, simpler and straightforward than involving 3 entities. While i understand the problem of **autocracy** might arise, we stakeholders will provide the checks and balances to compensate. Each elected individual will be given the power and task with vetting and reviewing the quality of contractors and their works in respective sub domains.

Elected officials may one day be required for smaller roles that are just inefficient to manage otherwise,  but for something as important as vetting contractors, we should stay clear of it as much as we can.

Having a central point of authority on a subject imply setting him up as a single point of failure. Even if the elected individual is fair and responsible, if conflict arise with a contractor, the official becomes a single point of frustration for this contractor.  And then it's easy to feel wronged and have the accusations start flying to have this one person replaced even though he may have acted  objectively.

When the responsibility falls to a group of multiple contractors there will of course be situation where conflict will occur,  but I believe we remove quite a lot of the possible drama and followup issues.","a42f357c78e3a9260e844633362ffe4ac89b15595d4ca459fa28ac2533f7935cd7816b71b397ab86210b1fc5be7bed5447fe178f92223221f1f4b8b3b8ca4b09","0746d8cd9eb00daec05891d178d8030002322fb3168309c7b75b9eea8c2a5eb9","31","2061e0b5ed22cc0b97f5eba23b77adc21e5b1eee1c1d4ea734757e17bdd8cf119a09f3cea00ccc7ed2305b0c4d79fde27d43032bd4890cfe0c486274e7b7720c",1540130468,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/31",3,3,3,0,0

Given all else that has been discussed I'm guessing no, but this should be made explicit: the process of obtaining a DCC is different than joining one of the existing core development teams (from which you can bill and whose budget will be discussed in a different proposal) and/or getting approval for participation in a particular proposal which would allow the originating entity (either an independent contractor or a corporate contractor) to actually bill for that particular proposal.

My concern is making explicit the dynamics for development teams/companies, the goals of the DCC system in particular and, more broadly, the high level goals of Politeia and the DAE.

I should contextualize that I'm from a country with somewhat strong worker protection laws, in which it's expensive to hire, maintain and terminate worker contracts, any given company can be easily sued for (improper, even if non intentional) worker compensation and (usually) loses those suits. And in full disclosure, I'm also trying to bring in some new developers following the proposed format for the DCCs.

Therefore I'll use a hypothetical example to tease out some of these concerns: Development shop Alpha (that currently does not have DCC holding employees) wants to propose a given software. Let's assume the idea itself is sound, well accepted and the team is generally regarded as competent at a first glance.

So now, the team from Alpha will have to get DCCs in order for the proposal to be put up for voting. Alpha itself (assuming it's a standard consulting business) will bear the cost for the work performed by their employees while acquiring the DCC. These developers will then be eligible for participation in Alpha's proposal.

Now, will Alpha's devs be able to directly bill for work performed (outside the context of Alpha's proposal)? Or will there be a separate process from which they'll have to join one of the existing core teams (possibly incidentally terminating their employment contract with Alpha)?

I assume this sort of situation will only be answerable in time, as we get more experience with Politeia and evolve the DAE. 

But we should make it explicit if the system is designed to be contractor-centric (a dev getting a DCC while working for a corporate contractor is only granted it as it relates to that corporation's proposals) or DCC-holder-centric (once you get a DCC, it's personally yours whether you remain in the contractor that ""sponsored"" you or not - and corporate contractors should have that in mind when hiring, training and maintaining employees).","c1eb060d262206df4358f3febcd325d66f5739bc18752477684b2230478d806baf7f1b04af5d8f22680355e9ca6252013c824d741c804614cb2fda1fb3b04502","6b6ca6070313029795d7445323b130ada779195ff8f10fd07ba9d1627460f686","33","848c7e9bd0a381f0662e57545d858d6a4ce0fe197c07f715d77226dc7cc3de9dbc135d87c4cc6dd00b79461e63b6619ab647660ddaa676c78c19fae134790a06",1540211214,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/33",7,9,8,1,1

3. I was just thinking it might be good to include a statement in the proposal condemning corporate vote manipulation and recommending a penalty be enforced.

  I realize we can't make this code-enforced, but I was thinking along the lines of how the Decred Constitution states the 21 million supply limit. There's nothing that actually prevents an on-chain vote from modifying that limit, but most stakeholders would be opposed to it since it runs contrary to the Constitution. Likewise, if we make a recommendation of penalizing corporate vote manipulation in this proposal, it's highly likely that an all-contractor vote (or stakeholder vote) will enforce this recommendation.","dd03dc7e55ef90539635b1b1e438d95e0d79c9812433699d6b25f768a27ed3df5d78f8f7ca4f2f87496fdb55d6cda2a835f62f7c1afc245f947de8fbeb09fd02","1f2e01bc09347d229da8260ab014223faaf48ad6e18931800d6e6c4a952f5106","34","44633da62af91308893d0fc193e9a164cd4e6b56d3e9a2b0ef3ed8d026ab48a39b5aef2e2acf99c10e5d7cd8543c8b651efcc78b1295dfc5a2152654208b0603",1540247684,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/34",3,3,3,0,0

I like this proposal. The existing process (show up, do, apply), is great. It's how employment should work, IMO. However, it requires a large leap of faith on the part of potential contractors. People have to invest a significant amount of time and energy up front, with no guarantee of being paid. From Decred's perspective, this is totally reasonable. Prospective contractors require a significant investment from Decred, in the form of time and energy spent onboarding, reviewing work, training, etc., with no guarantee of getting valuable work in return. The current materials around becoming a contractor (docs, blogs, etc.) express all this very well, along with the ethos of the project. In the end, it worked out for me. I'm psyched to be able to commit more to the project. However, I can see how this process could exclude many talented people who either can't handle the higher levels of uncertainty, or who have fewer financial resources than I do. 

If there was a system like the one proposed, and it actually works as intended, I think my journey would have been less stressful, and probably more productive. I also like the idea of having more visibility into the hiring/firing process moving forward. Indeed, it's my first month. I could still not work out and not have my contract renewed (no hard feelings). But I would want to at least know why it didn't work out!

Related question: will existing contractors be automatically given a DCC? Or will there be some process for determining which existing contractors get DCCs?

My only concern is that this system becomes corrupted in ways other commenters have worried about. If this turned into office politics as usual, I'm out. However, I generally trust the project leads' deep understanding (theoretical and experiential) of governance, system design, and automation. And I think the Decred's general strategy of incremental rollout is wise and tested. E.g. I'm glad a human is still distributing funds from Pi for now. 

If this works, it could unleash huge productivity gains and make Decred an even more exciting experiment.

Stakeholders can't directly vote on contractors but they can defund anything they don't like. This is usually not the case for delegated democracies, where the voters cannot defund bad projects.

Another idea is that the DCC could be revoked by a stakeholder vote without waiting for proper escalation (3 contractor vote -> all contractor vote -> stakeholder vote), that could be blocked by a cartel. Is this possible in the DCC process, @jy-p? Soft skills boil down to whether an individual can work with existing contractors without damaging his or others' productivity. If his English is poor, but others understand him, are not too irritated and like his deliverables, that will work. If he uses explicit language or jokes on diversity, but nobody is offended and no productivity is lost, that will work. Even if a person is a total devil he can look for a semi-isolated corporate entity, work via a ""softening proxy assistant"", or start his own company where he is nice to stakeholders but yells at his subordinates. If a corporate entitiy tries to force its employees to vote a certain way, the employee as an individual will have to decide for himself. If he succumbs to employer order that goes against the benefit of stakeholders, he risks losing reputation and his DCC. The fact that DCC is granted to individuals as opposed to blurry companies is helpful here. Stakeholders are incentivized by their skin in the game to not be fooled by the developers, and any contractors in general. This is a fundamental human problem of delegation.

* How the group of 3 contractors is selected? Does it change between the vouching rounds?
* Does one need to obtain a DCC for every domain he wants to contribute to?
* How and where is the DCC persisted/registered? What identity is the DCC attached to? Is there something like existing contractors signing a public key of the newly cleared contractor?
* Can anonymous contributor obtain a DCC?
* Who and how will be able to verify the weighting by the hours billed? Does it mean all billing data will be made public?
* Is there a list of subdomains, or a draft?
* I assume the contractor-mgmt system will be a single, central server running Politeia-derived software, with some publicly verifiable data. Is there a backup plan for when the operation of this server is interrupted? Will it paralyze the work of all contractors?

More general questions about Politeia, using this prop as an example:

* Will we need a Pi vote to change this DCC process?
* Will there be a repo or Pi feature for policy docs like this?","63f044de472be1faf3aeb8da98c9c0606a77b1b52f1dd3f90903abaf7fc00c87fa619834c08399f10d5337b50a5c8e45fefcad9d1c7198ca29346e368bcc1d0f","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","44","3fa49d60c3aff8e2ca77b78e95f92c20970216b4c11ca8af1d7c5191c72098771925de368beda52b6530b4cae744561e2670d465b774da87e3ccf2636d353609",1542748854,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fa38a3593d9a3f6cb2478a24c25114f5097c572f6dadf24c78bb521ed10992a4/comments/44",3,3,3,0,1

I have to say I am delighted to finally see this initiative brought to a formal discussion.

Even though on the surface it goes against the idea of decentralisation, an aggregate site for the community to help them stay abreast of the most recent Decred developments such as articles, translations, events, and so on and so forth is a very welcome addition, as it will enable us to spread the Decred meme further and more effectively and will give current initiatives even more reach as finding them in one place would be super convenient, plus the original content stays where it is.

Would you mind clarifying, though, if the asked 6k USD budget would go towards building out the *under construction* features of the website, or to cover the initial bringup costs of the site (as in everything that made it look as is now) and then the running costs would be infrastructure costs + a hard-capped budget for keeping the site up to date?","429ea13905d9c6dc3b29653cd43f7e8f6d9c94198fde690d621e54fb48052bd5201c5ce6002bb5a5fccef905d140dfc453f0f225bc005fe5e22c9130c8ca2c08","c4a52c0cf07e9b57b162e8f1ee57583e8d69dea8267126152229d602df55ee42","1","e1e1b2d161107acabf3c9ee296858f0fba80726a5eb8a57b886f69f98b093ac3ac6644beb34337b8e96d1f89782f193cc42bd97532e596e957fa484b071c8a01",1550865252,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/1",1,3,2,1,0

To extend this time i will post a new proposal after 6 months. At this point it should be mentioned again that i don't intend to use the maximum budget! I'm currently assuming 20 minutes for adding an article (decred journal, decred digest, event-reports) with text formatting and pictures. At the moment it's expected that these articles will be available in 2 - 3 different languages. Decred contributors additionally write 4-5 articles per month, in rare cases they are also available in several languages. In addition, there are sporadic video interviews and podcasts from soundcloud. Realistically, i currently assume a maximum effective working time of 5-10 hours per month. In addition, there are server and infrastructure upgrades. Therefore, i keep a frame of 15 hours sufficient. I will only bill for the time i effectively work. So it could end up beeing less than this. I simply have to find out at this point.

The maximum budget is given because maybe there will be wishes for functional expansion in the future (stats page, timestamping service...) and act as a buffer for unexpected cases. Especially in combination with the marketing effords of the project there could be needs for cross-plattform campaigns. Maybe there could be need for a helping contributor hand on deadline deliverables. 

I will give my best to be efficient and keep my workhours low. I have always maintained this attitude towards the project and this will not change.

The placement of advertisements will not happen! No paid advertisements will be placed on the site in the future. If there are advertising banners, then only for project internal purposes and campaigns which are free for the project.

I could set a lump sum as it is done in other proposals. However, this does not correspond to my imagination, so i decided for an expense allowance after hours because i consider this to be fair. The hardcap also has its purpose, but should never be used completely in the optimal case.","9beaa596bc28fab98182a6fb80facc9e5716312c8d25aa63be91926d8a848299a74c045005186a3a8802b36eca1306cda8353e9b69f8f440723de69ed138a302","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","13","e1fbc2b0e98b0d2384045bc6017293ae56fc9306b558ca8aaccf04dcffba09fad78a1928b77e4a0616ee282541dab38629796bffb19b5f0866061a424cb3ae04",1550934975,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/13",4,4,4,0,1

I feel that lots of aggregation work is already done by Decred Journal. It contains all the recent articles, videos, podcasts and even relevant chats on comms platforms. This makes the utility of this site only marginal in that section.

On the other hand, i think this will lead to more individual content and take off some load from bee's shoulders. My suggestion would be to update the proposal to list content from different contributors being aggregated e.g. Pi Digest, Haon's medium articles, Journal etc.

I like the mirroring of basic infrstructure services. To be sure, these will be independent instances of these services and not just links to the current instances, right?

You mention a Newsletter service, is this the same one that is proposed in [2019 Marketing Plan](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c84a76685e4437a15760033725044a15ad832f68f9d123eb837337060a09f86e)? If not is this not replication of same service and its costs? How will this be different?

Good to see, although voluntary and unpaid, translation work will be co-ordinated via the site.

Apart from above, I have three questions:

- Is this going to slowly replace Journal or both will keep working in parallel?

- What is meant by private and public photo gallery and areas of the site? can you explain with an example what these areas will be used for?

- Why can't this be added to main decred site under say community.decred.org? What are the benefits of doing a separate site?

Thanks for your work, looking forward to the updated proposal. I hope this helps.","17166632cfa300c6128d74797599a5b569616df3a56a42726062a37b4e9e47ce23412c22b7e81566355994ea70e5a1036463fe21216493e4421f7395af33c909","8b0efb1cdd09ced8194163ee0ea3b07f36c5507e90a02ca25a67bca9479448ee","16","ecfc6b5bef96b8ab773c4e9f104902910fe1546c4d8ec17f5ec792a6666215e53baaed62ebfb33964eb6f1840c3ac2f8813b7830f01f6bb65356e02c4e190207",1550972075,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/16",2,2,2,0,0

Access is granted to a selection of trusted contributors in the event of a failover/emergency. I would like 2-3 people who are able to make backups of the site and place content on it. Currently haon has access and he was introduced to working with the backend. If my response time asks for this situation due to an emergency or vacation, they should be able to tune in and post new content online. In this case they should be balanced out of this budget. What is important to me is that they are trustworthy and know what they are doing, what an introduction requires.

Writers are compensated by the Treasury and publish their articles on various platforms. I think if the project has paid for the production of this content, we should publish it on different platforms and not just keep it on individual platforms. I don't intend to manage the author's activities! I want to give them the opportunity to publish their content on this platform. Also for visibility and censorship resistance to what has happened in the past on the medium with crypto related content producers. I expect decred's main page to be more selective about the content they will publish, as the purpose of the main page is to inform and be more official. The purpose of this community page can be to give new people a chance to get a stance and establish in the project and a playground to try new things. The inspiration for this project came from zcsh and dsh, as they also run successful community outlets that attract engagement and displays healthy community activity.","0f37176978cab41faf0e6f6fe51c08d40a3283a1adc71e848932443ab51d3a711df6dbadd7ecbf2d798c58d1bb5ad60f5a9c34a3f67d8746b4457d978764d906","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","17","2303eb5b7502cac13d90f9827aba1008f545a0d2701dbbc0cbbcd6c9fc36f1c9d40e20ac7c3d8414a9ea016ce3cdd7649e1ff0f87a916bb07b439bf9b8ea9e03",1550980126,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/17",3,3,3,0,0

I have spoken with various contributors from the field, both in chats and on meetups. The idea was welcomed and I started working on the proposal a while ago.

The site should only serve as a platform for the output of the decred community. It should not replace anything, it should complement! It should inform and motivate new people to participate in the project. You should keep in mind that different target groups prefer different ways of presentation. Showing presence only on Github or the main page may not be enough.

Basically, every content financed by the treasury should find its place on the site, but not only that. Therefore I don't want to limit myself to certain sections (pi digest, haon, richardred, journal) (see section 'what'). There is no reason why these sections should not be supplemented in the future. Contributor profiles, author profiles, voices of individual stakeholders on certain topics, all the things that have no official character can find their place here.

Infrastructure, of course, are independent instances, this also emerges from the proposal (see 'ongoing budget'). We will use the ressources that the server has available for these.

Concerning the photo galleries I noticed that there are already a lot of pictures of conferences and meetings. These should be displayed clearly instead of being scattered on twitter. Visitors of the Meetups should have the possibility to find each other again. Regarding the privately accessible areas, there was a desire to provide materials especially for investors and the press.

The main page is informal. A horizontal diversification in the external presentation of the projects should enrich the ecosystem. As I said, I expect a rather conservative attitude from the main page in the future, the outsourced community page can only enrich here.

There are several possible approaches to the newsletter. Whether this is only used as a subscription for the official newsletter or whether additional content may also be played out here will have to be agreed with the marketing team.","e499b733aff81c652e0167f9724f32438ca2f6a9fd62d4a15543b15f39409263c3da40cd29955427ff898e7d3e5ed378c34558c216fa3a268906e25269d5db00","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","18","2e21d8c00b4e9f7fb72faeecdfc79f37e598104e8a8bc144686687e7c279188c116a3787b88f0cec4a215d519afe5a0d52a32f901379db4bbc045e9ac7f9900d",1550982697,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/18",2,2,2,0,0

* Proposal presents a working prototype.
* The prototype looks solid and is immediately useful for all the content it has already organized.
* The fact that the author built the prototype upfront with his own money shows that he is passionate and will likely actively work on it in the future. This is in the spirit of Decred.
* The budget is fair, if not modest.
* Content tagged by People and other categories is a powerful way to navigate.
* Blog that aggregates multiple authors, video and audio, future events calendar and past events reports, list of merchants, architecture for multilingual content - are all long needed. I have a ton of designs for these, but they barely progress as drafts. Glad to see someone took it much further!

### Not liked

* The voting was rushed after just a few days of discussion. Combined with mostly secret development it gives very little time to think and discuss. Since the idea is sound, in case this voting round fails I suggest to not give up, adjust and try again.
* Web fonts abuse. With web fonts and SVG disabled all icons are missing. This is my personal thing, normal people don't have this problem.

### Questions

Tech:

* Is site code open?
* What software stack is used?

Knowledge preservation (my [obsession](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/labels/archiving)):

* Can I clone and sync all site content?
* Can I selectively clone and sync only low-footprint textual articles?
* Can I run a mirror of the website?
* What formats are used to store content?
* Will it mirror video content from YouTube to protect it form destruction?
* Can it consume raw Markdown?
* Governance: how content is curated? Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?
* Track record: is content versioned?

Features:

* Is non-js experience high on the priority list?
* If this is paid by the Treasury, there will be no sponsored content, no ads and no third party user tracking, right?
* Will site usage stats/metrics be public info? Talking about aggregate, anonymized stats that can be collected without javascript on your self-hosted (first party) HTTP server.
* How private content works?
* Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?
* Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?
* Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content? 

Org:

* How long did it take to build the prototype (tech and content)?
* Do you know (have you negotiated with) people willing to curate content?
* What is the overlap with dcrweb (e.g. newsletter)? How do you envision cooperation with dcrweb? Any ideas to avoid duplicate work?


### Notes

* If anybody could spin a mirror of this website (see Knowledge preservation above), it removes most (if not all) centralization concerns.
* This has a lot of overlap with [dcrweb#561](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/561).
* [dcrweb#579](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb/issues/579) is applicable to community website too.
* The site can be built from multiple smaller data projects useful on their own, e.g. merchants data can live in its own repo and be consumed by the website's build process.","f26a035a7966734fbe495f500d960a92c2659862e9a9cbe057836077dc8d6d41cc341b0ec2f171f9a1616f2ad74b80214bea230274660a13fe767e31ec0b1704","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","54","7dbccbfb2544d249d82a0efaa059edcd97a54ba02425638bcaf501faed4f4b6ac88689246bc945770362620657f33958be97ab8bfd310b5befb017fc4e30f005",1551379195,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/54",2,4,3,1,1

- *Can I clone and sync all site content?* 

No, only chance currently would be to download a static version or see next answer: 

```
wget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent http://example.org
```

- *Can I selectively clone and sync only low-footprint textual articles?*

Not yet but will be available via RSS

- *Can I run a mirror of the website?*

No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

-*What formats are used to store content?*

XHTML - has a rich-text-editor at the backend, no coding needed.

-*Will it mirror video content from YouTube to protect it form destruction?*

Thinkable but not planned. Each video would have to be served in 3 different file formats. Could be generated serverside with ffmpeg. A lot of storage would be needed, maybe an additional mediaserver would make sense in that case. From frontend side it already supports local served video, but is not in scope of my proposal.

- *Can it consume raw Markdown?*

Yes, converts to XHTML when storing in sql database.

- *Governance: how content is curated? Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?*

CMS backend editor. I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited, reviewed and published by admins/editors in the backend.

- *Track record: is content versioned?*

No. There is only a report on activity of the admins in the backend (what content/code section they touched when), but no versioning/old versions of the articles/changes.

Features:

- *Is non-js experience high on the priority list?*

Yes. Non-js experience at this point way better than dcrweb ux. But for some things js is mandatory, like video or soundcloud player, gallery- and slide effects.

- *If this is paid by the Treasury, there will be no sponsored content, no ads and no third party user tracking, right?*

Correct. Either way, there will never be tracking, sponsored adds or other kind of stupid things of this kind.

- *Will site usage stats/metrics be public info?*

I have deactivated all of this serverside. I am not interested in that crap. I would agree to embed piwik-visitor stats chunk of the decredproject. Marketing could work with that internaly, i have no access to this.

- *How private content works?* 

If there is need for this from the marketing team it could be available. Various approaches are thinkable. User login based with different access level/roles, or simply a simple single page password that protects content.

- *Can photos have metadata like pictured people or event it was shot at?*

Each single photo can have an individual title and description. Images are organized into photogalleries/folders, currently each event has one. I will work on the Event Detail page to show Event gallery, report, videos etc.

- *Will it support RTL text (Arabic, Hebrew, etc)?*

Yes, supports RTL. From backend side no limitations on languages/lexicons. If at some point someone steps forward to redesign the page, an RTL version css for the frontend would have to be provided.

- *Are there feeds to subscribe for and follow certain categories of content?*

Prototype already supports this. https://decredcommunity.com/site-map Click on the RSS icon. Can be made available for every section granualy. After i am happy with the deliverable i would start to work on an RSS reader Android app. Got a concept in the drawers.


Org:

- *How long did it take to build the prototype (tech and content)?*

I realy have no idea at this point. I did it in my freetime and did not track my worktime. I started the concept back in November. The marketing proposal was a surprise and so i rushed a little to put the prototype proposal up.

- *Do you know (have you negotiated with) people willing to curate content?*

No negotiatons. Was getting help for the landing page from noah. Displayed the site in different stages to contributors i have met on meetups and discussed ideas. Others have already stepped forward to help with lexicon (site/lexicon/allaround navigation) translations.

I will create 'submit forms' for the different sections in the front-end side. Everyone will be able to suggest/submit content that have to be edited and reviewed by admins.

My plan is to work things out and create roles (content creator, editor, publisher) for different sections/translations on the backend side. After that there would be the need to create introduction videos on how to work in the backend for those different roles. By time it would be possible to grant more people restricted access to their area of work. This could be done once the site and their sections are build out but is a process to be planned in the future. At the current state it is simply a one-man job and my experience with scaled multilanguage cms based website is, there is a learning curve involved in working with the backend and you realy want to seperate creators/proof readers/editors/publishers(remove). Nontheless i will grant 2-3 people admin access for emergency purposes, like i already have mentioned. Having a solid multi-user/role setup takes planing and coordination. It is very granuarly. Therefore i want to build the site with functionality out and when i have streamlined it introduce new people potentially.

- *What is the overlap with dcrweb (e.g. newsletter)? How do you envision cooperation with dcrweb? Any ideas to avoid duplicate work?*

I am not planning to create newsletter content. I already answered that question, newsletter functionality is strong in the framework. It could be used to organize and publish newsletters, it could just be used for subscription(unsuscribe, multi topic selections/lists, optin functions etc.). The marketing team has to decide this. Either just a .csv with un-subscriptions or as a full blown newsletter service.","0e81b279154bd3d2edf289124771da06a6fe4de7313b718b33d8d5be49619055d90cbd413154071e1fe85ace84f385a1a1a23b31a3a18f0bd494b84f4ce4740e","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","56","b93e87b31021ed700be3eb5f73352ecc5aaf1918f60924d2218c75b7638bbd26c948f6a68df26c0f3ac0aa4cc0a03de15b321ec520f67454328aae0908da240c",1551391902,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/56",3,3,3,0,0

> It is build on a open source cms, runs php and mysql

What about site's own source code? I mean any custom settings of the CMS, custom code, scripts, Docker, etc. I mean a public repo like [dcrweb](https://github.com/decred/dcrweb) or [dcrbounty](https://github.com/decred/dcrbounty).

> wget --mirror

Ahhh... I did a ton of wget and I absolutely hate it. It is brittle, unreliable, slow and inefficient. After initial download is done, it either gives no incremental sync at all (because most sites suck HTTP-wise) or needs to HEAD every damn URL on the site (can be thousands) to grab a few new pages.

I was hoping for something as robust and fast as `git clone` and `git fetch`. This is why Decred Journal is a [git repo](https://github.com/xaur/decred-news) since day one - you can grab it all in a blink of an eye and sync it later in another blink. Anyone can anonymously get a full local copy of the data and read it offline. If I go to vacation, disappear or go nuts, anybody could quickly host a mirror without searching those couple chosen guys I shared backup keys with. What I'm looking for is git-based content repo like DJ but bigger, with multiple authors. Now I see it (indestructible knowledge repo) is completely different effort and doesn't overlap much with the website, whose primary purpose is to aggregate everything in one place. In fact they could work together.

> Can I mirror? -> No. Would mean you got the database, which includes logins to the cms backend.

So the data is not open :(

To clarify, I'm looking to replicate content only, without logins. Perhaps it can be separated somehow. Having public content mirroring interface (git, rsync or similar) would be awesome to protect content long-term.

> XHTML

Source of truth in XHTML is better than HTML I guess, but worse than Markdown imo.

> video hosting not planned

Got it, so it does not overlap with [file archive](https://github.com/xaur/decred-issues/issues/26).

> Is it possible to change or remove content, and how?

I guess the answer is yes, admins/operators can just remove it from the database, with only a few admins possible seeing it in the logs.

> metrics

To be clear, I mean first party non-intrusive non-javascript metrics only. No tracking pixels. Plain old HTTP request counting on _your_ own server, aggregated by country, to know how many users visit the site and from what countries. Metrics are important to measure site success, and imo HTTP-based first party metrics are legit.","5082731bb9ed3e10d27c415414136bd028396e520b051d00686f21bba53a4cb9b9660d3016a0f35ed1782082efc2a6972d03c643011dee08af8bd083707ac60d","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","57","25a95ebc2dcbd47d73db0e41830535fb740a1d0876c5e3c5a3fce84ea6b3dea6576fa85580e8ecdfbf82fe065d5a5ea12a29297222bfe701c143fba5799e090b",1551398643,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/57",2,2,2,0,1

It can be possible that it will happen but this would need a custom export and packager. You have to know that this is tricky in the nature of php/mysql driven cms, as these configs are mostly bound to absolute local paths, bond to a specific domain etc.

When an article has the comment function enabled you introduce more pita and possible inconsistency.

I guess with the right path it can be anonymized and dockerized, but this is currently out of scope.

Regarding HTML - articles could be styled and formated in a more complex way, they could include floating images/text layouts. Keep in mind that not only .md files or github repos will be the source of contents here.

Regarding STATS - that stuff is currently all disabled. The cheapest solution is to run awstats that ships with apache. I am absolutely not interested to run any stats at all. Decred.org is running piwik afaik. They could just add the site and pass me the tracking-snippet and i would integrate it into the site. Then they would have visitor statistics all aggregated in their solution.","3dc48f1db7a19cf562f5db04bd1d6eff791b267a6d57b324890c75330afc0a5b1bb057b378e8c10c09cbb82ba472c866cbf0926805e057317878c95915078e00","e0e3133b3d628b5975dc30151aa9e1c66491595d90a84f5fde5a2ef5edb4d831","58","dab33b43e1bb14731057116978f4a31c2b80105bb18c2a7285c665e6809d3fff51612f517b4b97684fe51aaade3fd1d12bc8d00b47cdc5f70c86d10b28b4e908",1551400615,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/58",1,1,1,0,0

My biggest concern with that stack is centralized data lock-in. Static sites with full source and data on GitHub like dcrweb or dcrbounty can be fully cloned by dozens or hundreds of decred fans without permission. This is not the case with this website.

Your suggested measure to share backup keys with several trusted community members is not ideal, but is a workable solution.

To be more resilient (and relief my concerns) I suggest to:

* Increase the amount of ""data backup"" people to 4-5.
* Add at least one ""backup webmaster"" person who could reinstate the site from data backup in your absence. He can also serve as one of ""data backup"" people.
* Publicly secure commitment of the above people to make periodic backups and help to restore the site in case of emergency.","7c3fdd5d574157c3dfbaa0413a841ee3e2c390d5f4c4fd832b23708a0323b5bf86a10b9c835fce3ce5fe27e0e81b3c2c3bc06c2bc410aa46e3c87b305e6f3f08","a717216ef1999f84d71aec664b4d14f90616a09b67c7c68892b8e8fe9e8b1441","59","b15c315c335197492da5863071de5c00132747c06319b9b60e503d6cccc33bcdca4fdd9e87e65606c1b6efac85770d4aadb5af732cf9775548e21ea0a3d0f905",1551517378,0,0,FALSE,NA,"fb8e6ca361c807168ea0bd6ddbfb7e05896b78f2576daf92f07315e6f8b5cd83/comments/59",0,2,1,1,1
